        <span class="abst" title="Computational Quantum Chemistry has developed into a powerful, efficient, reliable and increasingly routine tool for exploring the structure and properties of small to medium sized molecules. Many thousands of calculations are performed every day, some offering results which approach experimental accuracy. However, in contrast to other disciplines, such as crystallography, or bioinformatics, where standard formats and well-known, unified databases exist, this QC data is generally destined to remain locally held in files which are not designed to be machine-readable. Only a very small subset of these results will become accessible to the wider community through publication.In this paper we describe how the Quixote Project is developing the infrastructure required to convert output from a number of different molecular quantum chemistry packages to a common semantically rich, machine-readable format and to build respositories of QC results. Such an infrastructure offers benefits at many levels. The standardised representation of the results will facilitate software interoperability, for example making it easier for analysis tools to take data from different QC packages, and will also help with archival and deposition of results. The repository infrastructure, which is lightweight and built using Open software components, can be implemented at individual researcher, project, organisation or community level, offering the exciting possibility that in future many of these QC results can be made publically available, to be searched and interpreted just as crystallography and bioinformatics results are today.Although we believe that quantum chemists will appreciate the contribution the Quixote infrastructure can make to the organisation and and exchange of their results, we anticipate that greater rewards will come from enabling their results to be consumed by a wider community. As the respositories grow they will become a valuable source of chemical data for use by other disciplines in both research and education.The Quixote project is unconventional in that the infrastructure is being implemented in advance of a full definition of the data model which will eventually underpin it. We believe that a working system which offers real value to researchers based on tools and shared, searchable repositories will encourage early participation from a broader community, including both producers and consumers of data. In the early stages, searching and indexing can be performed on the chemical subject of the calculations, and well defined calculation meta-data. The process of defining more specific quantum chemical definitions, adding them to dictionaries and extracting them consistently from the results of the various software packages can then proceed in an incremental manner, adding additional value at each stage.Not only will these results help to change the data management model in the field of Quantum Chemistry, but the methodology can be applied to other pressing problems related to data in computational and experimental science.">

In this article, we advance a major improvement to the semiempirical description of lanthanide complexes: the Recife Model 1, RM1, model for the lanthanides, parameterized for the trications of Dy, Ho, and Er. By representing such lanthanide in the RM1 calculation as a three-electron atom with a set of 5 d, 6 s, and 6 p semiempirical orbitals, the accuracy of the previous sparkle models, mainly concentrated on lanthanide-oxygen and lanthanide-nitrogen distances, is extended to other types of bonds in the trication complexes' coordination polyhedra, such as lanthanide-carbon, lanthanide-chlorine, etc. This is even more important as, for example, lanthanide-carbon atom distances in the coordination polyhedra of the complexes comprise about 30% of all distances for all complexes of Dy, Ho, and Er considered. Our results indicate that the average unsigned mean error for the lanthanide-carbon distances dropped from an average of 0.30 Å, for the sparkle models, to 0.04 Å for the RM1 model for the lanthanides; for a total of 509 such distances for the set of all Dy, Ho, and Er complexes considered. A similar behavior took place for the other distances as well, such as lanthanide-chlorine, lanthanide-bromine, lanthanide, phosphorus and lanthanide-sulfur. Thus, the RM1 model for the lanthanides, being advanced in this article, broadens the range of application of semiempirical models to lanthanide complexes by including comprehensively many other types of bonds not adequately described by the previous models.">

        <span class="abst" title="Connexin hemichannels are regulated by several gating mechanisms, some of which depend critically on the extracellular Ca(2+) concentration ([Ca(2+)]e). It is well established that hemichannel activity is inhibited at normal (∼1 mM) [Ca(2+)]e, whereas lowering [Ca(2+)]e to micromolar levels fosters hemichannel opening. Atomic force microscopy imaging shows significant and reversible changes of pore diameter at the extracellular mouth of Cx26 hemichannels exposed to different [Ca(2+)]e, however, the underlying molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated. Analysis of the crystal structure of connexin 26 (Cx26) gap junction channels, corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suggests that several negatively charged amino acids create a favorable environment for low-affinity Ca(2+) binding within the extracellular vestibule of the Cx26 hemichannel. In particular a highly conserved glutammic acid, found in position 47 in most connexins, is thought to undergo post translational gamma carboxylation (γGlu47), and is thus likely to play an important role in Ca(2+) coordination. γGlu47 may also form salt bridges with two conserved arginines (Arg75 and Arg184 in Cx26), which are considered important in stabilizing the structure of the extracellular region. Using a combination of quantum chemistry methods, we analyzed the interaction between γGlu47, Arg75 and Arg184 in a Cx26 hemichannel model both in the absence and in the presence of Ca(2+). We show that Ca(2+) imparts significant local structural changes and speculate that these modifications may alter the structure of the extracellular loops in Cx26, and may thus account for the mechanism of hemichannel closure in the presence of mM [Ca(2+)]e.">

Hence our mapping is efficient. The required set of controllable interactions includes only two types of interaction beyond the Ising interactions required to apply the quantum adiabatic algorithm to combinatorial optimization problems.

However, large uncharted territories persist due to its size scaling combinatorially with molecular size. We report computed geometric, energetic, electronic, and thermodynamic properties for 134k stable small organic molecules made up of CHONF. These molecules correspond to the subset of all 133,885 species with up to nine heavy atoms (CONF) out of the GDB-17 chemical universe of 166 billion organic molecules. We report geometries minimal in energy, corresponding harmonic frequencies, dipole moments, polarizabilities, along with energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization. All properties were calculated at the B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of quantum chemistry. Furthermore, for the predominant stoichiometry, C7H10O2, there are 6,095 constitutional isomers among the 134k molecules. We report energies, enthalpies, and free energies of atomization at the more accurate G4MP2 level of theory for all of them. As such, this data set provides quantum chemical properties for a relevant, consistent, and comprehensive chemical space of small organic molecules. This database may serve the benchmarking of existing methods, development of new methods, such as hybrid quantum mechanics/machine learning, and systematic identification of structure-property relationships.">

In addition, the valence shell is described by three electrons in a set of 5d, 6s, and 6p orbitals. Results indicate that the present model is more accurate than the previous sparkle models, although these are still very good methods provided the ligands only possess oxygen or nitrogen atoms directly coordinated to the lanthanide ion. For all other different types of coordination, the present RM1 model for the lanthanides is much superior and must definitely be used. Overall, the accuracy of the model is of the order of 0.07Å for La(III) and Pr(III), and 0.08Å for Ce(III) for lanthanide-ligand atom distances which lie mostly around the 2.3Å to 2.6Å interval, implying an error around 3% only.">

Typical examples of amino acid salt bridge, cation-π, and amide bridge interactions are analyzed, including the inhibitor design targeting neuraminidase (NA) enzyme of influenza A virus, and the ligand binding interactions in the HCV p7 ion channel. The inhibition mechanism of the M2 proton channel in the influenza A virus is analyzed based on strong amino acid interactions.(1) The salt bridge interactions between acidic amino acids (Glu- and Asp-) and alkaline amino acids (Arg+, Lys+ and His+) are the strongest residue-residue interactions. However, this type of interaction may be weakened by solvation effects and broken by lower pH conditions. (2) The cation- interactions between protonated amino acids (Arg+, Lys+ and His+) and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp and His) are 2.5 to 5-fold stronger than common hydrogen bond interactions and are less affected by the solvation environment. (3) The amide bridge interactions between the two amide-containing amino acids (Asn and Gln) are three times stronger than hydrogen bond interactions, which are less influenced by the pH of the solution. (4) Ten of the twenty natural amino acids are involved in salt bridge, or cation-, or amide bridge interactions that often play important roles in protein-protein, protein-peptide, protein-ligand, and protein-DNA interactions.">

These workflows are executed on computing infrastructures and may require large computing and data resources. Scientific workflows hide these infrastructures and the resources needed to run them. It requires significant efforts and specific expertise to design, implement and test these workflows.Many of these workflows are complex and monolithic entities that can be used for particular scientific experiments. Hence, their modification is not straightforward and it makes almost impossible to share them. To address these issues we propose developing atomic workflows and embedding them in meta-workflows. Atomic workflows deliver a well-defined research domain specific function. Publishing workflows in repositories enables workflow sharing inside and/or among scientific communities. We formally specify atomic and meta-workflows in order to define data structures to be used in repositories for uploading and sharing them. Additionally, we present a formal description focused at orchestration of atomic workflows into meta-workflows.We investigated the operations that represent basic functionalities in Quantum Chemistry, developed the relevant atomic workflows and combined them into meta-workflows. Having these workflows we defined the structure of the Quantum Chemistry workflow library and uploaded these workflows in the SHIWA Workflow Repository.Graphical AbstractMeta-workflows and embedded workflows in the template representation.">

However, these methods can hardly fulfill the exponentially-growing resource requirements when applied to large quantum systems. As pointed out by Feynman, this restriction is intrinsic to all computational models based on classical physics. Recently, the rapid advancement of trapped-ion technologies has opened new possibilities for quantum control and quantum simulations. Here, we present an efficient toolkit that exploits both the internal and motional degrees of freedom of trapped ions for solving problems in quantum chemistry, including molecular electronic structure, molecular dynamics, and vibronic coupling. We focus on applications that go beyond the capacity of classical computers, but may be realizable on state-of-the-art trapped-ion systems. These results allow us to envision a new paradigm of quantum chemistry that shifts from the current transistor to a near-future trapped-ion-based technology.">

A few (in)organic and transition-metal complexes are presented, and very good, unprecedented agreement between the theoretical and experimental spectra was achieved.

Thus, a deep understanding of this drug/receptor complex is essential for the improvement of new drugs targeting the protein PD-1. In this context, by employing quantum chemistry methods based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate in silico the binding energy features of the receptor PD-1 in complex with its drug inhibitor.

Continuous wave (CW) and time-resolved laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy (TRLFS) data of uranyl(vi) hydrolysis were analyzed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Distribution patterns of five major species were thereby derived under a fixed uranyl concentration (10-5 M) over a wide pH range from 2 to 11. UV (180 nm to 370 nm) excitation spectra were extracted for individual species. Time-dependent density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations revealed ligand excitation (water, hydroxo, oxo) in this region and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) responsible for luminescence. Thus excitation in the UV region is extreme ligand sensitive and specific. Combining findings from PARAFAC and DFT the [UO2(H2O)5]2+ cation (aquo complex 1 : 0) and four hydroxo complexes (1 : 1, 3 : 5, 3 : 7 and 1 : 3) were identified.

        <span class="abst" title="Doping is an extremely important process where intentional insertion of impurities in semiconductors controls their electronic properties. In organic semiconductors, one of the convenient, but inefficient, ways of doping is the spin casting of a precursor mixture of components in solution, followed by solvent evaporation. Active control over this process holds the key to significant improvements over current poor doping efficiencies. Yet, an optimized control can only come from a detailed understanding of electronic interactions responsible for the low doping efficiencies. Here, we use two-dimensional nonlinear optical spectroscopy to examine these interactions in the course of the doping process by probing the solution mixture of doped organic semiconductors. A dopant accepts an electron from the semiconductor and the two ions form a duplex of interacting charges known as ion-pair complexes. Well-resolved off-diagonal peaks in the two-dimensional spectra clearly demonstrate the electronic connectivity among the ions in solution. This electronic interaction represents a well resolved electrostatically bound state, as opposed to a random distribution of ions. We developed a theoretical model to recover the experimental data, which reveals an unexpectedly strong electronic coupling of ∼250 cm-1 with an intermolecular distance of ∼4.5 Å between ions in solution, which is approximately the expected distance in processed films. The fact that this relationship persists from solution to the processed film gives direct evidence that Coulomb interactions are retained from the precursor solution to the processed films. This memory effect renders the charge carriers equally bound also in the film and, hence, results in poor doping efficiencies. This new insight will help pave the way towards rational tailoring of the electronic interactions to improve doping efficiencies in processed organic semiconductor thin films.">

Here, we demonstrate that AD can be used to compute gradients with respect to any parameter throughout a complete quantum chemistry method. We present DiffiQult, a Hartree-Fock implementation, entirely differentiated with the use of AD tools. DiffiQult is a software package written in plain Python with minimal deviation from standard code which illustrates the capability of AD to save human effort and time in implementations of exact gradients in quantum chemistry. We leverage the obtained gradients to optimize the parameters of one-particle basis sets in the context of the floating Gaussian framework.">

The molecules of epiisopiloturine, epiisopilosine, isopilosine, pilosine, and macaubine were evaluated using theory models (B3lyp/SDD, B3lyp/6-31+G(d,p), B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p)). Absorption, distribution, metabolization, excretion, and toxicity (ADMET) predictions were used to determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the alkaloids. After optimization, the molecules were submitted to molecular docking calculations with the purine nucleoside phosphorylase, thioredoxin glutathione reductase, methylthioadenosine phosphorylase, arginase, uridine phosphorylase, Cathepsin B1 and histone deacetylase 8 enzymes, which are possible targets of Schistosoma mansoni. The results showed that B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p) was the optimal model to describe the properties studied. Thermodynamic analysis showed that epiisopiloturine and epiisopilosine were the most stable isomers; however, the epiisopilosine ligand achieved a superior interaction with the enzymes studied in the molecular docking experiments, which corroborated the results of previous experimental studies on schistosomiasis.">

They can be obtained in the framework of crystal chemistry and quantum chemistry approaches, which are mostly applied as alternatives to each other. This paper verifies the convergence of the two approaches by analyzing a plethora of quantum chemistry data available in the literature. The exponential correlation between the electron descriptors [BO ij and ρc(ij)] and the length of chemical bonds, Rij , which is basic in crystal chemistry, was confirmed for 72 atom pairs, regardless of the nature of their interactions (ionic/covalent, metal-metal, etc.). The difference between the BO ij  (Rij ) correlations obtained in this work and those accepted in crystal chemistry for the same atomic pairs does not exceed the dispersion of quantum chemistry data, confirming the qualitative validity of the BO conservation principle. Various examples are presented to show that knowledge of the exponential parameters ensures a surprisingly simple determination of two basic electron descriptors in any complex compound with known interatomic distances. In particular, the BO analysis for 20 Re6-cluster complexes illustrates the BO conservation for systems with delocalized electrons. Despite the significant transfer of electron density from the Re-Re to the Re-ligand bonds, the total number of Re valence electrons used in bonding remains close to the formal value of seven electrons.">

A great deal of theoretical algorithmic development has been performed in support of this goal. Most techniques require a scheme for mapping electronic states and operations to states of and operations upon qubits. The two most commonly used techniques for this are the Jordan-Wigner transformation and the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation. However, comparisons of these schemes have previously been limited to individual small molecules. In this paper, we discuss resource implications for the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev mapping scheme, specifically with regard to the number of quantum gates required for simulation. We consider both small systems, which may be simulatable on near-future quantum devices, and systems sufficiently large for classical simulation to be intractable. We use 86 molecular systems to demonstrate that the use of the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is typically at least approximately as efficient as the canonical Jordan-Wigner transformation and results in substantially reduced gate count estimates when performing limited circuit optimizations.">

Quantum computers can perform full-CI calculations in polynomial time against the system size by adopting a quantum phase estimation algorithm (QPEA). In the QPEA, the preparation of initial guess wave functions having sufficiently large overlap with the exact wave function is recommended. The Hartree-Fock (HF) wave function is a good initial guess only for closed shell singlet molecules and high-spin molecules carrying no spin-β unpaired electrons, around their equilibrium geometry, and thus, the construction of multiconfigurational wave functions without performing post-HF calculations on classical computers is highly desired for applying the method to a wide variety of chemistries and physics. In this work, we propose a method to construct multiconfigurational initial guess wave functions suitable for QPEA-based full-CI calculations on quantum computers, by utilizing diradical characters computed from spin-projected UHF wave functions. The proposed approach drastically improves the wave function overlap, particularly in molecules with intermediate diradical characters.">

The following research deals with the preparation of novel types of N-doped chitosan-based carbon quantum dots. Nanomaterials were obtained with simultaneous nitrogen-doping using biocompatible amino acids according to Green Chemistry principles. For the carbon quantum dots synthesis chitosan was used as a raw material known for its biocompability. The nanomaterials obtained in the form of lyophilic colloids were characterized by spectroscopic and spectrofluorimetric methods. Their quantum yields were determined. Additionally the cytotoxicity of the prepared bionanomaterials was evaluated by XTT (2,3-Bis-(2-methoxy-4-nitro5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide salt) method. Our results confirmed the formation of biocompatible quantum dots with carbon cores exhibiting luminescence in visible range. Performed studies showed that modification with lysine (11.5%) and glutamic acid (7.4%) had a high impact on quantum yield, whereas functionalization with amino acids rich in S and N atoms did not significantly increase in fluorescence properties. XTT assays as well as morphological studies on human dermal fibroblasts confirmed the lack of cytotoxicity of the prepared bionanomaterials. The study shows chitosan-based quantum dots to be promising for biomedical applications such as cell labelling, diagnostics or controlled drug delivery and release systems.">

A group of down-converted CsPbX₃ (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite quantum dot light-emitting diode (LED) devices were constructed to demonstrate the potential use of such double/triple-halide CsPbX₃ perovskite quantum dots with full-spectrum luminescence. Based on density functional theory, we theoretically explored the properties of CsPbX₃ with double/triple anion atoms. The calculated band gaps provided strong support that the full-spectrum luminescence (410⁻700 nm) of double/triple CsPbX₃ can be realized with the change of the mixed-halide ratios, and hence that such PQDs are of potential use in optoelectronic devices.">

Outstanding single-exciton properties of CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots enable us to simultaneously study the two basic types of Auger recombination channels-negative trion and positive trion channels. Though Auger rates of positive trion are regarded to be much faster than that of negative trion for II-VI quantum dots in literature, our experiments find the two rates can be inverted for certain core/shell geometries. This is confirmed by theoretical calculations as a result of geometry-dependent dielectric screening. By varying the core/shell geometry, both types of Auger rates can be independently tuned for ~ 1 order of magnitude. Experimental and theoretical findings shed new light on designing quantum dots with necessary Auger recombination characteristics for high-power light-emitting-diodes, lasers, single-molecular tracking, super-resolution microscope, and advanced quantum light sources.">

Initial-state-resolved reaction probabilities, total integral cross sections, and rate constants of two H2 vibrational states, v 0 = 0 and 1, in the ground rotational state (j 0 = 0) are obtained at collision energies E coll ≤ 3 eV. We employ the lowest two excited diabatic electronic states of HeH2+ and their electronic coupling, a coupled-channel time-dependent real wavepacket method, and a flux analysis. Both probabilities and cross sections present a few groups of resonances at low E coll, whose amplitudes decrease with the energy, due to an ion-induced dipole interaction in the entrance channel. At higher E coll, reaction probabilities and cross sections increase monotonically up to 3 eV, remaining however quite small. When H2 is in the v 0 = 1 state, the reactivity increases by ~2 orders of magnitude at the lowest energies and by ~1 order at the highest ones. Initial-state resolved rate constants at room temperature are equal to 1.74 × 10-14 and to 1.98 × 10-12 cm3s-1 at v 0 = 0 and 1, respectively. Test calculations for H2 at j 0 = 1 show that the probabilities can be enhanced by a factor of ~1/3, that is ortho-H2 seems ~4 times more reactive than para-H2.">

Vibrational spectroscopy [infrared (IR) and Raman and near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy] is a major quality control tool in the detection and quantification of melamine content. The physical background for the measured spectra is not interpreted in analytical spectroscopy using chemometrics. In contrast, quantum mechanical calculations are capable of providing deep and independent insights therein. So far, the NIR region of crystalline melamine has not been studied by quantum mechanical calculations, while the investigations of its IR spectra have remained limited. In the present work, we employed fully anharmonic calculation of the NIR spectrum of melamine based on finite models, and also performed IR spectral simulation by using an infinite crystal model-periodic in three dimensions. This yielded detailed and unambiguous NIR band assignments and revised the previously known IR band assignments. We found that the out-of-plane fundamental transitions, which are essential in the IR region, are markedly more sensitive to out-of-plane inter-molecular interactions of melamine than NIR transitions. Proper description of the chemical surrounding of the molecule of melamine is more important than the anharmonicity of its vibrations. In contrast, the NIR bands mostly arise from in-plane vibrations, and remain surprisingly insensitive to the chemical environment. These findings explain previous observations that were reported in IR and NIR analytical studies of melamine.">

Steady-state and time-resolved fluorometry, UV-Vis absorption spectroscopy, and continuous-wave photolysis were utilized for this purpose. 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin formed mono- and bisporphyrin complexes with samarium(III), europium(III), and gadolinium(III) as representatives in the middle of the lanthanide series. The special photoinduced behavior of these compounds was mostly determined by the position of the metal center, which was located out of the ligand plane, thus distorting it. Besides, the photochemical and, especially, photophysical features of the corresponding mono- and bisporphyrin complexes were similar because, in the latter species, two monoporphyrins were connected by a weak metal bridge between the peripheral sulfonato substituents (tail-to-tail dimerization). The formation of these coordination compounds and the transformation reactions between the mono- and bisporphyrins were rather slow in the dark at room temperature. These processes were accelerated by visible irradiation. However, dissociation and, especially, redox degradation were the main photoreactions in these systems, although with low quantum yields. Additionally, depending on the excitation wavelength, new types of photoproducts were also detected.">

The CDs were prepared by one-pot method using glucose and PEG-200. The developed CDs showed blue luminescence under irradiation with ultra-violet. The Stern-Volmer quenching constant (K sv ) indicates the presence of static quenching mechanism. The apparent binding constant K a between antidepressant drugs with complex of SA-CDs have been determined. These results illustrated that CPZ shows strong binding with HSA. As further analyzed by FT-IR spectroscopy and DLS technique, the results suggested induced conformational changes on SA, thus confirming the experimental and theoretical results. Thus, a thorough knowledge of the energetics of drug-protein affinities in presence of CDs as attempted in this work is vital in giving way for appropriate drug delivery.">

Here, we fabricated N-doped micropore carbon quantum dots (NM-CQDs) with a high quantum yield and dual-wavelength photoluminescence (PL) emission from sustainable biomass using a pulsed laser ablation method. Interestingly, two coexisting indigo⁻blue photoluminescence (PL) emissions were clearly observed, elucidating that the excited electrons transited from the intrinsic π* orbital to the surface state (SS) formed from the saturation passivation. The quantum yield (QY) and fluorescence lifetime (FL) of the obtained NM-CQDs were as high as 32.4% and 6.56 ns. Further investigations indicated that the emission behaviors of NM-CQDs were still stable and independent in various conditions such as various excitation wavelengths, salt ionic concentrations, pH values, irradiation times, and temperatures. The obtained NM-CQDs are very suitable for cellular staining images due to strong and stable PL emission and show good internalization in different cells. Therefore, we propose a new and cost-effective preparation strategy for highly fluorescent NM-CQDs with great potential in biomedical imaging and engineering.">

Based on our investigation of its photophysical and electrochemical properties, Ru(pic) was found to display certain advantageous characteristics of wide-band absorption of visible light (λabs &lt; 670 nm) and stronger reduction ability in a one-electron reduced state ( E1/2red = -1.86 V vs. Ag/AgNO3), which should function favorably in photon-absorption and electron transfer to the catalyst, respectively. Performing photocatalysis using Ru(pic) as a redox photosensitizer combined with a Re(I) catalyst reduced CO2 to CO under red-light irradiation (λex &gt; 600 nm). TONCO reached 235 and ΦCO was 8.0%. Under these conditions, [Ru(dmb)3]2+ (Ru(dmb)) is not capable of working as a redox photosensitizer because it does not absorb light at λ &gt; 560 nm. Even in irradiation conditions where both Ru(pic) and Ru(dmb) absorb light (λex &gt; 500 nm), using Ru(pic) demonstrated faster CO formation (TOFCO = 6.7 min-1) and larger TONCO (2347) than Ru(dmb) (TOFCO = 3.6 min-1; TONCO = 2100). These results indicate that Ru(pic) is a superior redox photosensitizer over a wider wavelength range of visible-light absorption.">

Rigorous close coupling time-independent quantum reactive scattering calculations have been carried out on two potential energy surfaces, differing only at long-range in the reactants' channel. The results show that tunnel, resonance and virtual state effects enhance under-barrier reactivity giving rise to pronounced deviations from the Arrhenius law as temperature is lowered. Within the ultra-cold domain (below 1 mK), the reactivity is governed by virtual state effects and by tunneling through the reaction barrier; in the cold regime (1 mK-1 K), the shape resonances in the entrance channel of the potential energy surface make the quantum tunneling contribution larger so enhancing cross sections and rate constants by about one order of magnitude; at higher temperatures (above 10 K), the tunneling pathway enhanced by the constructive interference between two Feshbach resonances trapped in the reaction exit channel competes with the thermally activated mechanism, as the energy gets closer to the reaction barrier height. The results show that at low temperatures cross sections and rate constants are extremely sensitive to small changes in the long-range intermolecular interaction in the entrance channel of the potential energy surface, as well as to isotopic substitution.">

EuSn2P2 has a layered, Bi2Te3-type structure. Ferromagnetic interactions dominate the Curie-Weiss susceptibility, but a transition to antiferromagnetic ordering occurs near 30 K. Neutron diffraction reveals that this is due to two-dimensional ferromagnetic spin alignment within individual Eu layers and antiferromagnetic alignment between layers-this magnetic state surrounds the Sn-P layers at low temperatures. The bulk electrical resistivity is sensitive to the magnetism. Electronic structure calculations reveal that EuSn2P2 might be a strong topological insulator, which can be a new magnetic topological quantum material (MTQM) candidate. The calculations show that surface states should be present, and they are indeed observed by angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements.">

The generation procedure leverages at the same time experimental measurements and high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations. The procedure adopts an analytic formulation of the PES accounting for the dependence of the electrostatic and non-electrostatic components of the intermolecular interaction on the deformation of the monomers. In particular, the CO and N2 molecular multipole moments and electronic polarizabilities, the basic physical properties controlling the behavior at intermediate and long-range distances of the interaction components, were made to depend on relevant internal coordinates. The formulated PES exhibits substantial advantages when used for structural and dynamical calculations. This makes it also well suited for reuse in Open Molecular Science Cloud services.">

Here, we demonstrate that a unified picture of the covalent bond is achievable within the framework of machine learning-based force fields. Ridge regression, together with a representation of the atomic environment in terms of bispectrum components, can be used to map a general potential energy surface for molecular systems at chemical accuracy.

While investigating statistical mechanics perspectives (Aquilanti et al., 2017b, 2018), the concept of transitivity was introduced as a measure for the propensity for a reaction to occur. The Transitivity plot is here defined as the reciprocal of the apparent activation energy vs. reciprocal absolute temperature. Since the transitivity function regulates transit in physicochemical transformations, not necessarily involving reference to transition-state hypothesis of Eyring, an extended version is here proposed to cope with general types of transformations. The transitivity plot permits a representation where deviations from Arrhenius behavior are given a geometrical meaning and make explicit a positive or negative linear dependence of transitivity for sub- and super-Arrhenius cases, respectively. To first-order in reciprocal temperature, the transitivity function models deviations from linearity in Arrhenius plots as originally proposed by Aquilanti and Mundim: when deviations are increasingly larger, other phenomenological formulas, such as Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann, Nakamura-Takayanagi-Sato, and Aquilanti-Sanches-Coutinho-Carvalho are here rediscussed from the transitivity concept perspective and with in a general context. Emphasized is the interest of introducing into this context modifications to a very successful tool of theoretical kinetics, Eyring's Transition-State Theory: considering the behavior of the transitivity function at low temperatures, in order to describe deviation from Arrhenius behavior under the quantum tunneling regime, a &quot;d-TST&quot; formulation was previously introduced (Carvalho-Silva et al., 2017). In this paper, a special attention is dedicated to a derivation of the temperature dependence of viscosity, making explicit reference to feature of the transitivity function, which in this case generally exhibits a super-Arrhenius behavior. This is of relevance also for advantages of using the transitivity function for diffusion-controlled phenomena.">

However, the factors governing the formation efficiencies of CSSs are still poorly understood, and light-induced electron-hole recombinations as deactivation pathways competing with desired charge accumulations are largely unexplored. This greatly limits the possibility to perform efficient multi-electron transfer, which is essential for artificial photosynthesis. We present a systematic investigation of two donor-sensitizer-acceptor triads (with different donor-acceptor distances) capable of storing as much as 2.0 eV in their CSSs upon the absorption of a visible photon. Using quantitative one- and two-pulse laser flash photolysis, we provide deep insights into both the CSS formation quantum yield, which can reach up to 80%, and the fate of the CSS upon further (secondary) excitation with green photons. The triad with shorter intramolecular distances shows a remarkable excitation wavelength dependence of the CSS formation quantum yield, and the CSS of this triad undergoes more efficient light-induced charge recombination than the longer equivalent by about one order of magnitude, whilst thermal charge recombination shows the exact opposite behavior. The unexpected results of our detailed photophysical study can be rationalized by detrimental singlet charge transfer states or structural considerations, and could significantly contribute to the future design of CSS precursors for accumulative multi-electron transfer and artificial photosynthesis.">

Like the familiar and widely used one-electron density that represents the probability of finding an electron at a given location in space, the one-nucleus density represents the probability of finding a nucleus at a given position in space independent of the location of the other nuclei and independent of their type. In contrast to the electrons, however, the nuclei are comparably localized. Due to this localization of the individual nuclei, the one-nucleus density provides a quantum-mechanical representation of the &quot;chemical picture&quot; of the molecule as an object that can largely be understood in a three-dimensional space, even though its full nuclear probability density is defined on the high-dimensional configuration space of all the nuclei. We study how the nodal structure of the wavefunctions of vibrationally excited states translates to the one-nucleus density. It is found that nodes do not necessarily lead to visible changes in the one-nucleus density: Already for relatively small molecules, only certain vibrational excitations change the one-nucleus density qualitatively compared to the ground state. It turns out that there are simple rules for predicting the shape of the one-nucleus density from the normal mode coordinates. A Python module for the computation of the one-nucleus density is provided at https://gitlab.com/axelschild/mQNMc.">

We present an experimental realization of deterministic continuous-variable remote state preparation in the microwave regime over a distance of 35 cm. By employing propagating two-mode squeezed microwave states and feedforward, we achieve the remote preparation of squeezed states with up to 1.6 dB of squeezing below the vacuum level. Finally, security of remote state preparation is investigated by using the concept of the one-time pad and measuring the von Neumann entropies. We find nearly identical values for the entropy of the remotely prepared state and the respective conditional entropy given the classically communicated information and, thus, demonstrate close-to-perfect security.">

Quantum confined semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots (QDs), were predicted to have long-lived hot carriers enabled by a phonon bottleneck, i.e., the large inter-level spacings in QDs should result in inefficient phonon emissions. Here we study the effect of quantum confinement on hot carrier/exciton lifetime in lead halide perovskite nanocrystals. We synthesized a series of strongly confined CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with edge lengths down to 2.6 nm, the smallest reported to date, and studied their hot exciton relaxation using ultrafast spectroscopy. We observed sub-ps hot exciton lifetimes in all the samples with edge lengths within 2.6-6.2 nm and thus the absence of a phonon bottleneck. Their well-resolved excitonic peaks allowed us to quantify hot carrier/exciton energy loss rates which increased with decreasing NC sizes. This behavior can be well reproduced by a nonadiabatic transition mechanism between excitonic states induced by coupling to surface ligands.">

A single composite method calculation executes several low-level calculations to reproduce the results of high-level ab initio calculations with the aim of saving computational costs. Therefore, our database reports the results of the various methods (e.g., density functional theory, Hartree-Fock, Møller-Plesset perturbation theory, and coupled-cluster theory).

The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.">

A persistent challenge has been the development of cyclometalated iridium complexes with deep blue luminescence that have the requisite color purity, efficiency, and stability to function in color displays. In this work we report a new class of cyclometalated iridium complexes with saturated blue luminescence. These complexes have the general structure Ir(C^C:NHC)2(C^C:ADC), where C^C:NHC is an N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) derived cyclometalating ligand and C^C:ADC is a different type of cyclometalating ligand featuring an acyclic diaminocarbene (ADC). The complexes are prepared by a cascade reaction that involves nucleophilic addition of propylamine to an isocyanide precursor followed by base-assisted cyclometalation of the ADC intermediate. All three emit deep blue light with good quantum efficiencies (Φ PL = 0.13-0.48) and color profiles very close to the ideal primary blue standards for color displays.">

Application of the N-CDs/P25 material for the photocatalytic decomposition of Rhodamine B (RhB) gave improved activity relative to P25. The best degradation activity obtained at 6mL N-CDs/P25 under visible light irradiation, which shows a 13.06 fold photocatalytic activity over P25.

We sought to probe the influence of metal-ligand covalency on spin-lattice relaxation, which comprises the upper limit of coherence time. Specifically, we studied the impact of the first coordination sphere on spin-lattice relaxation through a series of four molecules featuring V-S, V-Se, Cu-S, and Cu-Se bonds, the Ph4P+ salts of the complexes [V(C6H4S2)3]2- (1), [Cu(C6H4S2)2]2- (2), [V(C6H4Se2)3]2- (3), and [Cu(C6H4Se2)2]2- (4). The combined results of pulse electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and ac magnetic susceptibility studies demonstrate the influence of greater M-L covalency, and consequently spin-delocalization onto the ligand, on elongating spin-lattice relaxation times. Notably, we observe the longest spin-lattice relaxation times in 2, and spin echos that survive until room temperature in both copper complexes (2 and 4).">

This level of control has recently been extended to the nanoscale with single emitter strong coupling even at room temperature using plasmonic nanostructures. However, emitters in static geometries, limit the ability to tune the coupling strength or to couple different emitters to the same cavity. Here, we present tip-enhanced strong coupling (TESC) with a nanocavity formed between a scanning plasmonic antenna tip and the substrate. By reversibly and dynamically addressing single quantum dots, we observe mode splitting up to 160 meV and anticrossing over a detuning range of ~100 meV, and with subnanometer precision over the deep subdiffraction-limited mode volume. Thus, TESC enables previously inaccessible control over emitter-nanocavity coupling and mode volume based on near-field microscopy. This opens pathways to induce, probe, and control single-emitter plasmon hybrid quantum states for applications from optoelectronics to quantum information science at room temperature.">

These neutral and sandwiched lanthanide compounds exclusively contain fully π-coordinated coplanar eight and nine membered CH rings. The magnetic properties of these compounds are investigated, leading to the observation of slow relaxation of the magnetization, including open hysteresis loops up to 10 K for the Er(III) analogue. Fast relaxation of the magnetization is likewise observed near zero field, a highly important characteristic for quantum information processing schemes. Our synthetic strategy is straightforward and utilizes the reaction of [(η8-C8H8)LnI(thf)n] complexes with [K(C9H9)]. Although all compounds are fully characterized, structural details of the title compounds can also be deduced by Raman spectroscopy only.">

A lesser-known transform, the Kravchuk-Fourier (KT), allows one to operate on finite strings of arbitrary length. It is of high demand in digital image processing and computer vision but features a prohibitive runtime. Here, we report a one-step computation of a fractional quantum KT.

However, their delivery and accumulation into cells can be challenging and there is still lack of detailed information. Thereby, the application of advanced fluorescence techniques can expand the portfolio of useful parameters for a more comprehensive evaluation. Here, we encapsulated hydrophilic quantum dots into liposomes for studying cellular uptake of these so-called lipodots into living cells. First, we investigated photophysical properties of free quantum dots and lipodots observing changes in the fluorescence decay time and translational diffusion behaviour. In comparison to empty liposomes, lipodots exhibited an altered zeta potential, whereas their hydrodynamic size did not change. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS), both combined with two-photon excitation (2P), were used to investigate the interaction behaviour of lipodots with an insect epithelial tissue. In contrast to the application of free quantum dots, their successful delivery into the cytosol of salivary gland duct cells could be observed when applying lipodots. Lipodots with different lipid compositions and surface charges did not result in considerable differences in the intracellular labelling pattern, luminescence decay time and diffusion behaviour. However, quantum dot degradation after intracellular accumulation could be assumed from reduced luminescence decay times and blue-shifted luminescence signals. In addition to single diffusing quantum dots, possible intracellular clustering of quantum dots could be assumed from increased diffusion times. Thus, by using a simple and manageable liposome carrier system, 2P-FLIM and 2P-FCS recording protocols could be tested, which are promising for investigating the fate of quantum dots during cellular interaction.">

Therefore, sensitive determination of FA in complex matrix is necessary. Molecularly imprinted polymers-coated CdTe quantum dots (CdTe-QDs@MIPs) exhibited incomparable advantages because of their combination of excellent selectivity of MIPs and high sensitivity of QDs. Here, a fluorescent probe based on CdTe-QDs@MIPs was successfully fabricated for selective and sensitive determination of FA. MIPs shell was obtained by the reverse microemulsion method using FA, 3-(aminopropyl) triethoxysilane (APTES), and tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS), as template, functional monomer, and crosslinker. In optimal conditions, the fluorescence CdTe-QDs@MIPs sensor exhibited fast response (within only 3 min), high sensitivity (limit of detection, LOD at 0.85 μg/l), excellent linear ranges (2-100 μg/l) with a correlation coefficient of 0.9996, and distinguished selectivity for FA. Satisfactory recoveries from 91.8% to 110.3% were achieved with precisions below 6.6% for FA analysis in real pineapple juice and apple juice by developed CdTe-QDs@MIPs. The fluorescence results coincided well with those obtained by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). It could be concluded that the resultant CdTe-QDs@MIPs offered a new way for rapid and sensitive analysis of FA in the complex matrix.">

While optical transition dipole moments (TDMs) in zero to two-dimensional optical emitters have been well investigated, those in quantum rings remain obscure despite their utmost relevance to the quantum photonic applications of quantum rings. Here, we study the dimensionality and orientation of TDMs in CdSe quantum rings. In contrast to those in other two-dimensional optical emitters, we find that TDMs in CdSe quantum rings show a peculiar in-plane linear distribution.

This allows us to unwind the individual spectral lines by isotopic composition and rotational quantum number and reveals a rich network of bright and perturbing dark states.

This work reports a systematic theoretical study on the reaction mechanisms and rate constants for hydrogen abstraction reactions by hydrogen and hydroxy radicals from a series of alkyne molecules with different structural propargyl C-H atoms. Geometry optimizations and frequency calculations for all species are performed at M06-2X/cc-pVTZ level of theory and the hindered internal rotations are also treated at this level. The high-level W1BD and CCSD(T)/CBS theoretical calculations are used as a benchmark for a series of DFT calculations toward the selection of accurate DFT functionals for large reaction systems in this work. Based on the quantum chemistry calculations, rate constants are computed using the canonical transition state theory with tunneling correction and the treatment of internal rotations. The effects of the structure and reaction site on the energy barriers and rate constants are examined systematically. To the best of our knowledge, this work provides the first systematic study for one of the key initiation abstraction reactions for compounds containing propargyl hydrogen atoms.">

Thus, the goal of this work was to trigger the release of active Transforming Growth-Factor Beta (TGF-β) via magnetic hyperthermia by binding SPIONs to the latent form of TGF-β, since heat has been shown to induce release of TGF-β from the latent complex. Commercially available SPIONS with high specific absorption rates (SAR) were hydrolyzed in 70% ethanol to create surface carboxylic acid conjugation sites for carbodiimide chemistry. Fourier-Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) analysis verified the conversion of maleic anhydride to maleic acid. 1-Ethyl-2-(3-dimethyulaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and N-hydroxysulfosuccinimide (Sulfo-NHS) were used to bind to the open conjugation sites of the SPION in order to graft latent TGF-β onto the particles. The resulting conjugated particles were imaged with transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and the complexed particles were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS) and superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometry. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to assess the thermally triggered release of active TGF-β from the latent complex, demonstrating that conjugation did not interfere with release. Results showed that latent TGF-β was successfully conjugated to the iron oxide nanoparticles, and magnetically triggered release of active TGF-β was achieved.">

Exploration of these phenomena is theoretically demanding, as polaritons exist at the intersection between quantum optics, solid state physics, and quantum chemistry. Fortunately, nanoscale polaritons can be realized in small plasmon-molecule systems, enabling treatment with ab initio methods. Here, we show that time-dependent density-functional theory calculations access the physics of nanoscale plasmon-molecule hybrids and predict vacuum Rabi splitting. By considering a system comprising a few-hundred-atom aluminum nanoparticle interacting with benzene molecules, we show that cavity quantum electrodynamics holds down to resonators of a few cubic nanometers in size, yielding a single-molecule coupling strength exceeding 200 meV due to a massive vacuum field of 4.5 V · nm-1. In a broader perspective, ab initio methods enable parameter-free in-depth studies of polaritonic systems for emerging applications.">

Using computational quantum chemistry to investigate the oxidative decomposition that govern voltage stability of multi-component organic electrolytes, we find that electrolyte decomposition is a process involving the solvent and the salt anion and requires explicit treatment of their coupling. We find that the ionization potential of the solvent-anion system is often lower than that of the isolated solvent or the anion. This mutual weakening effect is explained by the formation of the anion-solvent charge-transfer complex, which we study for 16 anion-solvent combinations. This understanding of the oxidation mechanism allows the formulation of a simple predictive model that explains experimentally observed trends in the onset voltages of degradation of electrolytes near the cathode. This model opens opportunities for rapid rational design of stable electrolytes for high-energy batteries.">

        <span class="abst" title="A quantitative understanding of the thermodynamics of biochemical reactions is essential for accurately modeling metabolism. The group contribution method (GCM) is one of the most widely used approaches to estimate standard Gibbs energies and redox potentials of reactions for which no experimental measurements exist. Previous work has shown that quantum chemical predictions of biochemical thermodynamics are a promising approach to overcome the limitations of GCM. However, the quantum chemistry approach is significantly more expensive. Here, we use a combination of quantum chemistry and machine learning to obtain a fast and accurate method for predicting the thermodynamics of biochemical redox reactions. We focus on predicting the redox potentials of carbonyl functional group reductions to alcohols and amines, two of the most ubiquitous carbon redox transformations in biology. Our method relies on semiempirical quantum chemistry calculations calibrated with Gaussian process (GP) regression against available experimental data and results in higher predictive power than the GCM at low computational cost. Direct calibration of GCM and fingerprint-based predictions (without quantum chemistry) with GP regression also results in significant improvements in prediction accuracy, demonstrating the versatility of the approach. We design and implement a network expansion algorithm that iteratively reduces and oxidizes a set of natural seed metabolites and demonstrate the high-throughput applicability of our method by predicting the standard potentials of more than 315 000 redox reactions involving approximately 70 000 compounds. Additionally, we developed a novel fingerprint-based framework for detecting molecular environment motifs that are enriched or depleted across different regions of the redox potential landscape. We provide open access to all source code and data generated.">

Utilising the combination of single quantum-state selection and an optimised two-pulse sequence to create a tailored rotational wavepacket, an unprecedented degree of field-free alignment, 〈cos2θ2D〉 = 0.96 (〈cos2θ〉 = 0.94) is achieved, exceeding the theoretical limit for single-pulse alignment. The very rich experimentally observed quantum dynamics is fully recovered by the angular probability distribution obtained from solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation with parameters refined against the experiment. The populations and phases of rotational states in the retrieved time-dependent three-dimensional wavepacket rationalises the observed very high degree of alignment.">

We use a parameterized band structure and a static model dielectric function, although a full ab initio implementation of our formalism is possible in principle. Our simulated spectra are in excellent agreement with experiments, including the quantum beats, while revealing the interplay between excitons and trions in molybdenum- and tungsten-based transition metal dichalcogenides.

This method is based on the analogies of NPs dipole interactions and the π-system in molecules. Differently from the Hartree-Fock method that is a self-consistent model, in this approach, the input data that this method requires is the dimer energy shift with respect to single NPs. This enables us to acquire a simultaneous estimation of the wavefunctions of the NPs system as well as the expectation energy value of every kind of NPs system. The main advantage of this approach is the rapid response and ease of application to every kind of geometries and spacing from the linear chain to clusters, without the necessity of a time-consuming calculation. The results obtained with this model are closely aligned to related literature and open the way to further development of this methodology for investigating other properties of NPs systems.">

Recently, the desire to understand and create quantum entanglement between particles such as spins, photons, atoms, and molecules is fueled by the development of quantum teleportation, quantum communication, quantum cryptography, and quantum computation. Although most of the work has focused on showing that entanglement violates the famous Bell's inequality and its generalization for discrete measurements, few recent attempts focus on continuous measurement results. Here, we have developed a general practical inequality to test entanglement for continuous measurement results, particularly scattering of chemical reactions. After we explain how to implement this inequality to classify entanglement in scattering experiments, we propose a specific chemical reaction to test the violation of this inequality. The method is general and could be used to classify entanglement for continuous measurement results.">

The surface of the synthesized N-CQDs was modified with amino functional groups. The results indicated that N-CQDs had various N-related functional groups and chemical bonds and were amorphous in structure. At the same time, the quantum yield of N-CQDs was 5.11%, and the average lifetime of fluorescence decay was 5.79 ns. The synthesized N-CQDs showed good selectivity for and sensitivity to Ag+. A linear relationship between N-CQDs detection efficiency and Ag+ concentration was observed for concentration ranges of Ag+ corresponding to 0-10 μM and 10-30 μM. In addition, N-CQDs were used for the detection of trace Ag+ in food packaging material. The silver ion content of the sample determined by the N-CQDs detection method was 1.442 mg/L, with a relative error of 6.24% with respect to flame atomic absorption spectrometry, according to which the Ag+ content was 1.352 mg/L. This indicates that the N-CQDs detection method is reliable. Therefore, the N-CQDs prepared in this paper can detect Ag+ rapidly, simply, and sensitively and are expected to be a promising tool for the detection of trace Ag+ in food packaging materials.">

The fluorescence spectra had single band gap features, and indicated the formation of alloy states rather than simple composite structures. The chemical compositions, photoluminescence (PL) emission wavelengths, and quantum yields of ZnxAgyInS1.5+x+0.5y nanocrystals were significantly influenced by the concentration of an organic capping agent. The appropriate proportion of 1-dodecanthiol in the precursor prevented the precipitation, increased the fluorescence quantum yield, and improved their optical properties. The proper ratio of capping agent allowed Zn, Ag, and In to form a better crystallinity and compositional homogeneity of ZnxAgyInS1.5+x+0.5y nanocrystals. The photoluminescence was tunable from blue to red in the range of 450-700 nm as the Ag content changed independently. The PL and absorption spectra of ZnxAgyInS1.5+x+0.5y nanocrystals showed a significant blue shift with the decrease of Ag content in the precursor. As there were no obvious differences on the average particle sizes of ZnxAgyInS1.5+x+0.5y samples, these results fully revealed the composition-dependent photoluminescence properties of ZnxAgyInS1.5+x+0.5y nanocrystals. The relative quantum yield reached 35%. The fluorescence lifetimes (τ1=115-148 ns and τ2=455-483 ns) were analogous to those of AgInS2 and (AgIn)xZn2(1-x)S2.">

Despite associations between general anesthesia and changes in physical properties such as electron spin, there has been no empirical demonstration that general anesthetics are capable of functional quantum interactions. In this work, we studied the linear and non-linear optical properties of the halogenated ethers sevoflurane (SEVO) and isoflurane (ISO), using UV-Vis spectroscopy, time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations, classical two-photon spectroscopy, and entangled two-photon spectroscopy. We show that both of these halogenated ethers interact with pairs of 800 nm entangled photons while neither interact with 800 nm classical photons. By contrast, nonhalogenated diethyl ether does not interact with entangled photons. This is the first experimental evidence that halogenated anesthetics can directly undergo quantum interaction mechanisms, offering a new approach to understanding their physicochemical properties.">

Our LEDs show an energy conversion efficiency of 10.7%, and an external quantum efficiency of 14.2% without outcoupling enhancement through controlling the concentration of the precursor solutions. The device shows low efficiency droop, i.e. 8.3% energy conversion efficiency and 14.0% external quantum efficiency at a current density of 300 mA cm-2, making the device more efficient than state-of-the-art organic and quantum-dot LEDs at high current densities. Furthermore, the half-lifetime of device with benzylamine treatment is 23.7 hr under a current density of 100 mA cm-2, comparable to the lifetime of near-infrared organic LEDs.">

A non-covalent imprinting approach was employed in this study due to the simplicity of preparation. Simple oxidative polymerization of the dopamine that creates the self-assembly monolayer seems to be an ideal choice. The QDs prepared by UV light irradiation synthesis were stabilized by using mercaptosuccinic acid. Formation of a complex of QD-antibody and QD-antibody-antigen was verified by using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. QDs and antibody were connected together via an affinity peptide linker. LA-ICP-MS was employed as a proof-of-concept for detection method of two types of immunoassay: 1) antigen extracted from the sample by MIP and subsequently overlaid/immunoreacted by QD-labelled antibodies, 2) complex of antigen, antibody, and QD formed in the sample and subsequently extracted by MIP. The first approach provided higher sensitivity (MIP/NIP), however, the second demonstrated higher selectivity.

Whilst the theoretical framework of the RPM is well-established, most experimental investigations have been conducted at fields several orders of magnitude stronger than the Earth's. Here we use transient absorption spectroscopy to demonstrate a pronounced orientation-dependence of the magnetic field response of a molecular triad system in the field region relevant to avian magnetoreception. The chemical compass response exhibits the properties of an inclination compass as found in migratory birds. The results underline the feasibility of a radical pair based avian compass and also provide further guidelines for the design and operation of exploitable chemical compass systems.">

        <span class="abst" title="While density functional theory (DFT) is often an accurate and efficient methodology for evaluating molecular properties such as energies and multipole moments, this approach often yields larger errors for response properties such as the dipole polarizability (α), which describes the tendency of a molecule to form an induced dipole moment in the presence of an electric field. In this work, we provide static α tensors (and other molecular properties such as total energy components, dipole and quadrupole moments, etc.) computed using quantum chemical (QC) and DFT methodologies for all 7,211 molecules in the QM7b database. We also provide the same quantities for the 52 molecules in the AlphaML showcase database, which includes the DNA/RNA nucleobases, uncharged amino acids, several open-chain and cyclic carbohydrates, five popular pharmaceutical molecules, and 23 isomers of C8Hn. All QC calculations were performed using linear-response coupled-cluster theory including single and double excitations (LR-CCSD), a sophisticated approach for electron correlation, and the d-aug-cc-pVDZ basis set to mitigate basis set incompleteness error. DFT calculations employed the B3LYP and SCAN0 hybrid functionals, in conjunction with d-aug-cc-pVDZ (B3LYP and SCAN0) and d-aug-cc-pVTZ (B3LYP).">

It is found that the size of the hysteresis loops is larger for QPCs of smaller aspect ratio (QPC channel width/length) and gradually disappears as their aspect ratio increases. The physical mechanisms responsible for a decrease in size of the hysteresis loops for QPCs with increasing aspect ratio are: (1) multimode transport in QPCs with larger channel width leading to spin-flip scattering events due to both remote impurities in the doping layer of the heterostructure and surface roughness and impurity (dangling bond) scattering on the sidewalls of the narrow portion of the QPC, and (2) an increase in carrier density resulting in a screening of the electron-electron interactions in the QPC channel. Both effects lead to a progressive disappearance of the net spin polarization in the QPC channel and an accompanying reduction in the size of the hysteresis loops as the lithographic width of the QPC channel increases.">
