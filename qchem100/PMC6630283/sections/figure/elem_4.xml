  <p>Cyclic voltammetry (CV) of BTC6 (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) and BTC0 (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) in a dichloromethane solution containing the electrolyte 0.1 M NBu
   <sub>4</sub>PF
   <sub>6</sub>. The compounds were measured at a concentration of 10
   <span class="sup">-3</span> M in the electrolyte solution, with an Ag wire reference electrode and a Pt disk working electrode (scan rate = 100 mV s
   <span class="sup">âˆ’1</span>). Ferrocene was used as an internal standard. Differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) was measured using the same electrolyte with 50 ms pulse width, 50 mV amplitude, 200 ms pulse period, and 4 mV potential increment.
