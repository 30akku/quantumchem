 <p>Luminescent liquid crystal materials (LLCMs) have been a hot research topic in the field of fluorescent materials. In this study, we successfully designed and synthesized an intense fluorescence thermotropic liquid crystal material with a fluorescence quantum yield (

Moreover, the alkyl chain attached to the terminus of the chromophore was able to promote the stability of electrochemical and thermal properties, which was beneficial to the device fabrication reproducibility and stability of the device performance.
