 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the electron-deficient feature of Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT), it has been widely used to construct a variety of donor-acceptor (D-A) systems with appropriate donor segments in π-conjugated small molecules or polymers. In this research, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f001" href="#materials-12-01919-f001">Figure 1</a>, thiophene and benzene segments were chosen as donor, and a Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) part was chosen as acceptor to construct a simple D-A system. Meanwhile, the flexible hexyl chain was attached to the terminus of the rigid backbone of the D-π-A core (BTC6) to generate a liquid crystal feature. A naked D-π-A core (BTC0) without a flexible alkyl chain was also designed and synthesized for comparison. Both BTC6 and BTC0 were synthesized via Stille coupling with excellent yields (
