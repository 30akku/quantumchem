  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the electron-deficient feature of Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT), it has been widely used to construct a variety of donor-acceptor (D-A) systems with appropriate donor segments in π-conjugated small molecules or polymers. In this research, as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f001" href="#materials-12-01919-f001">Figure 1</a>, thiophene and benzene segments were chosen as donor, and a Benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole (BT) part was chosen as acceptor to construct a simple D-A system. Meanwhile, the flexible hexyl chain was attached to the terminus of the rigid backbone of the D-π-A core (BTC6) to generate a liquid crystal feature. A naked D-π-A core (BTC0) without a flexible alkyl chain was also designed and synthesized for comparison. Both BTC6 and BTC0 were synthesized via Stille coupling with excellent yields (

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.2. The Photophysical Properties of BTC0 and BTC6 in Solution</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The UV-vis, photoluminescence (PL) and excitation spectra are shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f002" href="#materials-12-01919-f002">Figure 2</a>. In 
   <a rid="materials-12-01919-t001" ref-type="table" href="#materials-12-01919-t001">Table 1</a>, the wavelength of absorption and emission maximum, extinction coefficient (ε), Stokes shift, quantum yield (

   <sub>F</sub>), lifetime (
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>f</sub>), radiative decay rate constant (
   <span class="italic">k</span>
   <sub>r</sub>), and nonradiative decay rate constant (
   <span class="italic">k</span>
   <sub>nr</sub>) are summarized. The results showed that BTC6 and BTC0 had multiple absorption bands in both the solution and the solid state, with one band approximately 500 nm assigned to the intramolecular charge transfer from the donor to the acceptor core and the other band at approximately 350 nm assigned to the π–π* transition. In addition, the solvatochromic effect of the PL spectra was observed (
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-01919" href="#app1-materials-12-01919">Figure S1c,d, and Table S1</a>). When the solvent polarity was increased gradually from low-polarity hexane to high-polarity DMSO, both BTC6 and BTC0 exhibited a large redshift of approximately 70 nm, which indicated that the first singlet excited state (S
   <sub>1</sub>) of the dye possessed a strong intramolecular charge transfer characteristic.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Comparing the spectra of BTC6 and BTC0 in the solution (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f002" href="#materials-12-01919-f002">Figure 2</a>a,b), they did not exhibit marked differences with respect to spectral shape and the wavelengths of absorption and emission maximum. Additionally, the values of the Stokes shift, quantum yield (
   <span class="italic">Φ</span>
   <sub>F</sub>), lifetime &lt;
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>f</sub>&gt;, radiative decay rate constant (k
   <sub>n</sub>), and nonradiative decay rate constant (k
   <sub>nr</sub>) were very similar (
   <a rid="materials-12-01919-t001" ref-type="table" href="#materials-12-01919-t001">Table 1</a>, and 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-01919" href="#app1-materials-12-01919">Figure S2a</a>), indicative of the similar optical properties of the compounds in the solution. We presumed that the molecules existed in a practically monodispersed isolated state in dilute solution and that the length of the alkyl chain did not affect the electronic transition; therefore, the compounds had similar optical properties in the dilute solution.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By contrast, the two compounds showed a different optical performance in the solid state. Obviously, BTC0 had a smaller quantum yield and lifetime (
   <span class="italic">Φ</span>
   <sub>F</sub> = 0.10, &lt;
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>f</sub>&gt; = 1.97 ns) compared to that of BTC6 (
   <span class="italic">Φ</span>
   <sub>F</sub> = 0.26, &lt;
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>f</sub>&gt; = 7.17 ns). Furthermore, the k
   <sub>r</sub> value of BTC0 (5.07 × 10
   <span class="sup">7</span> s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) was 1.3 times that of BTC6 (3.63 × 10
   <span class="sup">7</span> s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>), while the k
   <sub>nr</sub> value of BTC0 (4.57 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>) was nearly 5 times that of BTC6 (1.03 × 10
   <span class="sup">8</span> s
   <span class="sup">−1</span>). The significant enhancement of the k
   <sub>nr</sub> in BTC0 was ascribed to the acceleration of the nonradiative deactivation channel arising from π−π interactions.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.3. PXRD Patterns of the Crystalline Powders of BTC0 and BTC6</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">According to the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f003" href="#materials-12-01919-f003">Figure 3</a>), the results showed that the distance between adjacent molecules of BTC6 was 4.16 Å, which is greater than the typical intermolecular π–π interactions of 3.80 Å. Thus, BTC6 avoided the quenching of fluorescence in the solid state. Moreover, BTC0 showed a closer distance (3.37 and 3.59 Å) within the range of intermolecular π–π stacking, thus making the intermolecular π–π interactions sufficiently strong to quench the fluorescence in the solid state. Apparently, the alkyl chains of the molecule trigger showed a different aggregation, as shown by the distinct differences in optical properties. BTC0 without alkyl chains had a strong interaction among the coupled cores to induce a short distance stacking of 3.37 and 3.59 Å. BTC6 with alkyl chains had van der Waals interactions among the alkyl side chains, which provided force to counterbalance against the interactions between the coupled cores, resulting in a longer distance of 4.16 Å. In summary, we can conclude that the existence of an alkyl chain induced the enhancement of optical properties in the solid state.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we determined the types of molecular aggregation. Two main species of dye aggregates are distinguished in the literature: For 
   <span class="italic">H</span>-aggregates, the absorption maximum of the aggregate is blue-shifted with respect to the isolated chromophore and fluorescence of the isolated chromophore is lost in the aggregate; for 
   <span class="italic">J</span>-aggregates, the absorption and emission maxima are red-shifted and no quenching occurs in the aggregate state [
   <a rid="B29-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29-materials-12-01919">29</a>,

   <a rid="B31-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-materials-12-01919">31</a>]. The common structural model for such aggregates is based on the longitudinal offset of the dye molecules, which is sometimes described as the deck-of-cards model (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f003" href="#materials-12-01919-f003">Figure 3</a>), in which the cards represent the molecules stacked on top of each other [

   <a rid="B33-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-materials-12-01919">33</a>]. By comparing the absorption and excitation spectra, the excitation at approximately 570 nm was the cause of emission and was red-shifted with respect to the isolated chromophore, indicating the formation of 
   <span class="italic">J</span>-type aggregates.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.4. Electrochemical Properties of BTC0 and BTC6</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the molecules had LUMO and HOMO energy levels of –2.6 and –5.0 eV, respectively (
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-01919" href="#app1-materials-12-01919">Figure S3</a>). To evaluate the compound energy levels experimentally, we investigated their electrochemical properties using cyclic voltammetry (CV) and differential pulse voltammetry (DPV) with ferrocene used as an internal standard. The electrochemical HOMO-LUMO band gaps are presented in 
   <a rid="materials-12-01919-t002" ref-type="table" href="#materials-12-01919-t002">Table 2</a>. These results clearly indicated that the alkyl chain slightly affected the HOMO-LUMO levels and the band gap of the dyes.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f004" href="#materials-12-01919-f004">Figure 4</a>, BTC0 and BTC6 exhibited a similar reversible reduction process. However, they showed a different oxidation process: BTC6 had two oxidation potentials, while BTC0 just had one oxidation potential. This characteristic can be explained by the molecular structure of BTC6. In BTC6, the active para-hydrogen in benzene was replaced by an inactive alkyl chain, which provided a protective effect and caused BTC6 to have a high resistance toward decomposition reactions, such as dimerization. Hence, BTC6 had a second oxidation potential, while BTC0 underwent decomposition reactions at that corresponding potential (such as electropolymerization, 
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-01919" href="#app1-materials-12-01919">Figure S4</a>). In summary, we can conclude that the alkyl chain can enhance the electrochemical stability of the molecule by replacing the active groups. Usually, the wider reversible redox potential range is favorable for the processes of device fabrication and other kinds of applications (organic light emitting diodes, sensors, etc.).

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2.5. Thermal Properties and the Liquid Crystalline Phase</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The thermal properties of the two molecules were investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The TGA analysis revealed that the 5% weight loss temperatures (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>d</sub>) of BTC6 and BTC0 were 366 and 314 °C, respectively (
   <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-materials-12-01919" href="#app1-materials-12-01919">Figure S5</a>). This result indicated that BTC6 had a better thermal stability, which can be attributed to the attached hexyl chain on BTC6, which can absorb more heat than BTC0.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the heating process, BTC0 showed crystal phases below 236 °C and an isotropic liquid phase above that temperature (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f005" href="#materials-12-01919-f005">Figure 5</a>a). In the cooling process, reverse phase transitions were observed. Interestingly, BTC6 showed a mesophase between the crystal phase and the isotropic liquid phase (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f005" href="#materials-12-01919-f005">Figure 5</a>b). In 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="materials-12-01919-f006" href="#materials-12-01919-f006">Figure 6</a>a, the texture of the mesophase observed with a polarized microscope (POM) is shown, namely, a fan-shaped texture, which is characteristic of the smectic phase [
   <a rid="B35-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-materials-12-01919">35</a>,
   <a rid="B36-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-materials-12-01919">36</a>,
   <a rid="B37-materials-12-01919" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-materials-12-01919">37</a>]. The smectic phase was reasonable because the enthalpy changes in the phase transition from the crystal phase to the mesophase (34.1 J/g) were larger than those from the mesophase to the isotropic liquid phase (5.12 J/g). This result means that in the mesophase, the crystal structure was considerably disrupted, but the ordered structure remained. This characteristic can be explained by the molecular structure of BTC6 with a rigid central core and flexible side chains.
