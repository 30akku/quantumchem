 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we successfully designed and synthesized an intense fluorescence thermotropic liquid crystal material (BTC6). The hexyl chain attached to the terminus of the rigid chromophore was used to produce the liquid crystal feature. At the same time, the inclusion of alkyl chains was an effective strategy to induce the enhancement of the fluorescence quantum yield (

Moreover, the alkyl chain was able to promote the stability of electrochemical and thermal properties, which was beneficial to the device fabrication reproducibility and stability of the device performance.
