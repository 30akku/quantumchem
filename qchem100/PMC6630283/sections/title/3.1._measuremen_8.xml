 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Air and water sensitive synthetic manipulations were performed under a nitrogen atmosphere using standard Schlenk techniques. All chemicals were purchased from Annaiji (Shanghai, China) or TCI (Tokyo, Japan) and used as received without further purification. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA, 400 MHz) spectrometer by using tetramethylsilane (0 ppm for 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR) as an internal standard. Absorption and fluorescence spectra were recorded on a Pekin Elmer Lambda 950 spectrophotometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) and a Thermo Lumina spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA), respectively, in a solution at room temperature (298 K) in a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length. For the fluorescence lifetime measurements we used a FluoroCube spectrometer (HORIBA Jobin Yvon, Kyoto, Japan) equipped with a picosecond pulse laser and a picosecond photon detection module (TBX). The fluorescence quantum yield was recorded on a Hamamatsu absolute PL quantum yield spectrometer C11347-11. All calculations were performed with Spartan 2016 and the geometry of the molecule was optimized through density functional theory (DFT) calculations at the restricted B3LYP level with 6-31G*(d) basis set. X-ray diffraction data were collected at 298 K on a Bruker D8 Advance with Cu KÎ± radiation (Billerica, MA, USA). The elemental analyses were carried out on an Elementar vario MICRO cube. The thermal properties of samples were measured using TA DSC7020 (TA Instruments, New Castle, DE, USA) in differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and TGA-Q50 in thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra were recorded on a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer device (Thermo Fisher Scientific Waltham, MA, USA).
