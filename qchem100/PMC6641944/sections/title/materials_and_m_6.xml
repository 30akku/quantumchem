  <span class="italic">A</span> to 
  <span class="italic">D</span>. Subsequently, they were filtered by bandpass filters with an FWHM of 3 nm angle-tuned to the central wavelength of their respective spectra to reduce the broadband background typically generated in dielectric nonlinear waveguides (
  <a rid="R28" ref-type="bibr" href="#R28">
   <span class="italic">28</span>
  </a>). The pump beam was discarded with an edge filter. The modes 
  <span class="italic">A</span> and 
  <span class="italic">D</span> were used for heralding and conditional creation of Fock states in modes 
  <span class="italic">B</span> and 
  <span class="italic">C</span>, which interfered in a variable ratio polarization-maintaining (PM) fiber coupler. The coupling ratio can be set in the range of 0 to 100% with an error of ±1.5%. The heralding signal modes (H-pol.) were centered at 1554 nm, while the interfering idler modes (V-pol.) were at 1546 nm. We used TESs running at 70 mK, which allowed for photon number–resolved measurements in all modes (
  <a rid="R29" ref-type="bibr" href="#R29">
   <span class="italic">29</span>
  </a>). Their voltage output was captured with an analog to digital converter (ADC) card.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Before demonstrating the HOM interference, we characterized the setup. A high–photon number resolution and single-mode input states are pivotal for this experiment. The resolution of TES detectors (the confidence that the detector gives a correct information about the number of photons) was previously confirmed to exceed 95% (
  <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">
   <span class="italic">20</span>
  </a>). The depth of the HOM dip of 85.9 ± 0.3% for a two-photon interference indicated an effective Schmidt-mode number 
  <span class="italic">K</span> = 1.16. For the measured 4-tuples of photon numbers, losses were computed by assuming perfect setup components, each followed by a BS with a reflection coefficient introducing the loss. We estimated that the total transmission in each mode to be approximately 50%. For the details, see the Supplementary Materials.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Measurements for individual settings of the splitting ratio were taken over approximately 400 s, giving 10
  <span class="sup">9</span> data samples for each 
  <span class="italic">r</span> ranging from 0 to 1 with a step of approximately 3%. Small error bars for low photon numbers and larger bars for the higher ones result from keeping the pump power fixed and near-single modeness of the interfering beams.
