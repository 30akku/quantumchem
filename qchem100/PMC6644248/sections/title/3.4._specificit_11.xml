 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Selectivity was one of the most important issues in fabrication of optical sensors. It was reported that phenylpropanoid acids (e.g., CA, pCA, and FA) could simultaneously quench the fluorescence of CdTe-QDs [
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">11</a>, 
  <a rid="B29" ref-type="bibr" href="#B29">29</a>]. Bare CdTe-QDs could not selectively detect phenylpropanoid acid; therefore, surface modification should be fabricated. Six structural analogues, chlorogenic acid (CGA), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid (4-HBA), caffeic acid (CA), 
  <span class="italic">p</span>-coumaric acid (pCA), vanillic acid (VA), and protocatechuic aldehyde (PA) with a concentration at 10 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l were selected and investigated to estimate the selectivity of CdTe-QDs@MIPs and CdTe-QDs@NIPs. As illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>, the quenching efficiency of FA was obviously different between CdTe-QDs@MIPs (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>0</sub>/
  <span class="italic">F</span>, 1.27) and CdTe-QDs@NIPs (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>0</sub>/
  <span class="italic">F</span>, 1.04), which verified that CdTe-QDs@MIPs had specific recognition ability to FA. However, CGA, 4-HBA, CA, pCA, VA, and PA quenching efficiencies all close to 1.00 were not easy to identify. Results further demonstrated that the recognition ability of CdTe-QDs@MIPs was based on the recognition sites.
