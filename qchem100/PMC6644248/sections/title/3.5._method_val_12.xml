 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Linearity, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), precision, and specificity were determined to investigate the method validation. The fluorescence intensities of CdTe-QDs@MIPs decreased with the increase of FA concentrations (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8(a)</a>). The fluorescence quenching efficiencies followed Stern–Volmer equation:

  <sub>0</sub>/
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 1 + 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>sv</sub>[
  <span class="italic">C</span>], where 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>sv</sub> and [
  <span class="italic">C</span>] were the quenching constant and FA concentrations. Furthermore, a good linearity (
  <span class="italic">F</span>
  <sub>0</sub>/
  <span class="italic">F</span> = 1.0688 + 0.0198 C) was observed at the concentration range from 2 to 100

  <span class="sup">2</span>) at 0.9996 (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig8" href="#fig8">Figure 8(b)</a>). LOD (0.85 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l) and LOQ (2.81 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l) were achieved for FA. Intraday RSD and interday RSD values over a five-day span were 0.62% and 1.61%, respectively, indicating the high reproducibility. Accordingly, the developed method was sufficiently practical for selective quantification of FA. To further investigate the developed performance, the results with other methods were compared [

  <a rid="B24" ref-type="bibr" href="#B24">24</a>]. As shown in 
  <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>, different methods have different superiorities and disadvantages. It can be seen the developed method was one of the most sensitive for FA quantification.
