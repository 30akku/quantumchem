 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence spectroscopy was investigated on a LS-55 fluorescence spectrometer (PerkinElmer Ltd., Washington, USA) and a Fluo Time 100 fluorescence spectrometer (PicoQuant, Germany). UV-vis absorption spectra were recorded using an UV-2600 spectrometer (Shimadzu, Tokyo, Japan). Functional groups were measured on a Nicolet-Avatar 360 Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrometer within the wavenumber from 400 to 4,000 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. Structure and morphology of CdTe-QDs@MIPs were determined on a Tecnai G2 20S-Twin transmission electron microscope (TEM, FEI, Prague, Czech Republic). The average value of the particle size was determined by a particle size analysis (PSA) (Malvern Instruments Ltd., Malvern, UK).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">HPLC analysis was carried out on an Agilent 1260 HPLC system with a UV detector at 322 nm (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA). A Waters SunFire-C
  <sub>18</sub> chromatographic column (250 nm × 4.6 mm i.d., 5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m, Waters, Milford, MA) was selected for separation at 25°C, and 0.3% acetic acid in ultrapure water/acetonitrile (20/80, v/v) was used as mobile phase for isocratic elution with a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min. Sample (20 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l) was injected directly into HPLC after passing through a 0.22 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m polytetrafluoroethylene syringe filter.
