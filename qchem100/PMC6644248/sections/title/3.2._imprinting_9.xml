 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5">Figure 5(a)</a>, the fluorescence lifetimes of CdTe-QDs@MIPs in the absence and presence of FA were 7.98 and 8.35 ns, respectively. The variable fluorescence lifetimes suggested that there existed energy or charge transfer between CdTe-QDs and FA [
  <a rid="B27" ref-type="bibr" href="#B27">27</a>]. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig5" href="#fig5"> Figure 5(b)</a> revealed that FA had adsorption bands at 300 and 322 nm, which were close to the band gap of CdTe-QDs [
  <a rid="B17" ref-type="bibr" href="#B17">17</a>], and far away from the emission spectrum (600 nm) of CdTe-QDs@MIPs. Therefore, charges in the conduction band of CdTe-QDs could transfer to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of FA, and energy resonance transfer was not the possible quenching mechanism. Furthermore, hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in FA could interact with the amino group in APTES through electrostatic interaction and hydrogen bond; therefore, it could be concluded that the observed fluorescence quenching was attributed to the charge transfer between FA and CdTe-QDs.
