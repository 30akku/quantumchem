 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For fluorescence quenching analysis of FA towards CdTe-QDs@MIPs and CdTe-QDs@NIPs, 0.3 ml of CdTe-QDs@MIPs or CdTe-QDs@NIPs solution (0.8 mg/ml) was dispersed in 2.7 ml of Tris-HCL buffer (10.0 mM and pH 8.0) and then 30.0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l of FA standard solution with different concentrations was added. After 3 min stirring process, the fluorescence spectra were recorded. In fluorescence detection, the excitation wavelength was set at 380 nm with an emission range of 550−650 nm, the excitation and emission slit width were both at 10 nm, and the photomultiplier tube voltage was tuned to 900 V.
