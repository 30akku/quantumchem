 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The practicability of the developed CdTe-QDs@MIPs-based sensor was further evaluated for quantitative analysis of FA in pineapple juice and apple juice. In addition to dilution, no sample pretreatment procedures were required. Recoveries of FA ranged from 91.8% to 110.3% with excellent RSD values less than 6.6% (
  <a rid="tab2" ref-type="table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>). Finally, FA was estimated in pineapple juice at a concentration of 724.6 ± 29.5 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l, and no FA was detected in apple juice.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China, FA was always quantified by HPLC-UV. Quantitative analysis of FA in pineapple juice and apple juice has been developed in our group by HPLC after MIPs extraction [
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">15</a>]. Results indicated the concentrations of FA in pineapple juice and apple juice were 683.3 ± 33.1 and 0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l, which were consistent with those determined by our developed CdTe-QDs@MIPs-based method.
