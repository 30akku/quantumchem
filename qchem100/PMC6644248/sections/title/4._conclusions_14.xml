 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, a fluorescent probe based on CdTe-QDs@MIPs was successfully synthesized. The molecular imprinting technique validated the selectivity of CdTe-QDs@MIPs. The thin MIPs layer made the fluorescent detection fast (response time for 3 min) and sensitivity high (LOD for 0.85 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>g/l). With the merits, the practicability of the proposed fluorescent method was verified by detection of FA in juices. The proposed strategy may offer an optimum approach to develop rapid and sensitive methods for biological, environmental, and clinical diagnostics applications.
