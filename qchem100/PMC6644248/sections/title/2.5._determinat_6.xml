 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The real sample applicability of the developed method was to analyze FA in pineapple juice and apple juice (Beijing Huiyuan Beverage and Food Co., Ltd., China) from local supermarket in Changsha. Fruit juices were filtered through a 0.22 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>m filter and further used without any sample pretreatment. Briefly, 30.0 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>l of fruit juices, 0.3 ml of CdTe-QDs@MIPs solution (0.8 mg/ml), and 2.7 ml of Tris-HCL buffer (10 mM, pH 8.0) were mixed and vortexed for 3 min, and then, the fluorescence intensities were recorded with excitation wavelength at 380 nm.
