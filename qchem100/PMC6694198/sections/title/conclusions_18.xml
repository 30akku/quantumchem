 <p id="Par34" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The MIP technology is currently experiencing a rapid development due to the limitations of natural recognition elements such antibodies or aptamers. However, neither MIP strategies are limitless. Therefore, the combination of these powerful tools in a specific immunoassay may bring highly selective approach. In this work, a MIP-based pseudo-immunoassay using NP-labelled antibody recognition was introduced and coupled with the sensitive detection technique – LA-ICP-MS. Two approaches of specific recognition were tested. The first one was based on the immunolabelling of the analyte captured by the MIP layer. The second approach involved immunolabelling of the analyte as a first step and the resulting QD-AB-AG complex was captured by MIP and further analyzed.</p>
 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The double-selective approach comprising of the specific immunolabelling reaction combined with isolation by MIP together with the LA-ICP-MS detection represents a viable approach of the IgG detection from a complex sample (LOD 4.2 μg and 1.6 μg, respectively) available for many exciting applications. Considering the overall time of the LA-ICP-MS analysis not exceeding 23 s (scan speed of 2000 μm/s), LA-ICP-MS is a promising technology to be used in future in conjunction with MIP technology.</p>
