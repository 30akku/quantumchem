 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prepared QDs were characterized by dynamic light scattering measuring the size, polydispersity, and zeta-potential using Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern, UK) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Moreover, fluorescence and absorbance spectroscopic characterization was performed using Plate reader Infinite 200 PRO (Tecan, Switzerland). Wavelength 350 nm was used as an excitation radiation and the fluorescence scan was measured within the range from 400 to 700 nm per 2-nm steps. The detector gain was set to 100. The samples were placed in UV-transparent 96 well microplate with flat bottom by CoStar (Corning, USA). To each well 50 μL of the sample was placed. All measurements were performed at 25 °C.</p>
