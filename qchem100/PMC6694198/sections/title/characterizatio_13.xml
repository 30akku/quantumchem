 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the characterization of CdS QDs their size, polydispersity, ζ-potential, and absorption and emission spectra were measured. From the DLS analysis follows that the average particle size is 18 nm and the negative value of ζ-potential (−41 mV) indicated that the prepared QDs were stable and did not aggregate. This measurement is supported by their emission spectrum showing the emission maximum to be 548 nm. Size distribution, DLS data as well as TEM micrographs are shown in S1–S3.</p>
