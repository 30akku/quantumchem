 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the threshold value for 
  <span class="sup">111</span>Cd signal was calculated. It was the lowest measured intensity taken into count for data evaluation. It was calculated as a sum of the average blank level of 
  <span class="sup">111</span>Cd signal and 10 fold standard deviation of a blank level. Blank level corresponding to intensities measured in carrier gas before ablation start. Time resolved signal of 
  <span class="sup">111</span>Cd was obtained for each spot and intensities, lower than the threshold value, were removed. Then total sum of intensities of 
  <span class="sup">111</span>Cd was calculated for each spot. The threshold value caused that the sum of intensities did not grow due to background level intensities.
