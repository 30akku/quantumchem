  </span> was used for the surface analysis allowing simultaneous acquisition of SEM and AFM images at the same place in the same coordinate system. The SEM contrast is sensitive to the sample composition, while the AFM provides real surface topography. The accelerating voltage of 5â€‰kV, beam current of 13 pA and SE detector was used for SEM imaging. The self-sensing Akiyama probe in tapping mode was used for the AFM measurement.
