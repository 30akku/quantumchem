 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The analysis of MIP was performed by LA-ICP-MS setup that consists of LA system UP213 (NewWave Research, USA) emitting laser radiation with a wavelength of 213 nm with a pulse width of 4.2 ns. The ablated material was carried out from an ablation cell by a flow of a He (1.0 l/min) into ICP-MS Agilent 7500CE (Agilent Technologies, Japan) with quadrupole analyzer. The optimized laser ablation parameters used for MIP and NIP analysis were following: laser beam diameter of 250 μm, the repetition rate of 10 Hz, laser beam fluence of 2 J/cm
  <span class="sup">2</span>, the scan speed of 2000 μm/s and distance between individual lines of 210 μm. The signal arising from CdS QD was monitored via isotope 
  <span class="sup">111</span>Cd. The whole spot of the sample was ablated by line patterns and signals of monitored isotopes were observed. The limit of quantification for signal intensity is calculated according to 10- fold of standard deviation of the gas level (without ablation). All intensities below LOQ were replaced by zero. Then sum intensity across the whole spot was calculated.

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As a blank value, three spots of NIPs were measured and the standard deviation was then calculated from the sum of intensities of each one. The slope value was obtained from the sum of intensities of MIP (2.5 μg of IgG).</p>
