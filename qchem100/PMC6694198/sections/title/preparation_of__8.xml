  <span class="sup">−1</span> in tris buffer pH 8.5) and the template (quantum dot-antibody = QD-AB, or quantum dot-antibody-antigen = QD-AB-AG complex) in a ratio of 1:1 was polymerized (overnight at room temperature) on the surface of the glass microscopic slide to form a thin film of polydopamine with specific cavities selective to analyte (QD-AB or QD-AB-AG complex). Non-imprinted layer (NIP) was used as a control. The MIP/NIP spot was in average 2 mm in diameter and all experiments (MIP as well as NIP) were performed in triplicates. The final concentration of the QD and AB in the template was therefore 0.055 mg ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 0.028 mg ml
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively. Then the template was removed by washing for five-times with 10 μl of acetic acid (10%) and twice with 10 μl of MilliQ water. The surface of polymer was blocked by using 5 μl mixture of milk (10%) and 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7 (90%) for 10 minutes. Subsequently, the surface was washed three-times with 10 μl of MilliQ water. Next, the sample (1 μl) containing the analyte was dosed on the imprinted surface and after 1 hour of interaction, the surface was rinsed three-times by MilliQ water (10 μl). It was necessary to prepare NIP, formed from polydopamine without the presence of the template. It served as a blank.
