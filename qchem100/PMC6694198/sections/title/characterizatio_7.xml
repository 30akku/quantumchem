 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Prepared conjugates were characterized by CE-LIF using Beckman PACE/MDQ with excitation using light emitting diode with emission wavelength of 395 nm. An uncoated fused silica capillary with total length of 47 cm and effective length of 40 cm was used. The internal diameter of the capillary was 75 μm. 20 mM sodium borate buffer (pH = 9) was used as a background electrolyte and the separation was carried out using 20 kV with hydrodynamic injection by 5 psi for 5 s
