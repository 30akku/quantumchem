 <p id="Par2" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The technology of imprinted polymers allows for a selective recognition of targeted analyte. It is based on a formation of an analyte recognition surface that is created after polymerization of a mixture of analyte and suitable monomer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
  </span>. Molecules or ions can be imprinted into polymers then molecularly or ion imprinted polymers (MIP or IIP, respectively) are formed. Nowadays, MIPs are used as specific selectors for pre-concentration of broad groups of analytes in food

  </span>, soil
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>, and biological samples (e.g. blood plasma
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>
  </span>). The main benefit of this technology is in its variability. Compared to conventional immunoassay, the use of MIP technology is applicable for analytes for which the antibodies are unavailable. Moreover, MIPs can be employed for a broad range of analytes (from ions to microorganisms) and take advantage of various surface arrangements (well-plates, microscopic slides, mass spectrometric targets, electrode and/or even nanoparticle surfaces). The monomer/polymer system can be also varied to provide not only suitable functional groups increasing the specificity of the interaction with the target analyte, but also suitable polymerization conditions
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10" href="#CR10">10</a>
  </span>. Moreover, a number of detection techniques (e.g., fluorescence spectrometry or microscopy, mass spectrometry, and/or quartz crystal microbalance) can be selected. The most commonly employed type of detection method is probably the quartz crystal microbalance
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, however extremely sensitive techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) may provide benefits for certain applications
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12" href="#CR12">12</a>
  </span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One of the polymers used for MIPs is polydopamine offering numerous benefits compared methacrylate and its derivatives
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. Polydopamine was used for the first time as a surface coating in 2007 by Lee 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>.
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14" href="#CR14">14</a>
  </span> and since then, the benefits of this material have been exploited in various fields including molecular imprinting
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>
  </span>. Simple oxidative polymerization of dopamine is involved during the formation of the self-assembly layer
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>
  </span>. Even though the detail mechanism of the polymerization is still not completely clear, it has been widely to create MIP on surfaces such as particles

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">MIPs have found its application in biochemistry and bioanalysis providing an alternative to antibodies used in immunoassays. Standard immunoassays are commonly visualized by optical techniques, such as fluorescence

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>
  </span>, however in some cases, a more sensitive detection is required. For such applications, metal-labelled antibodies in combination with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is the method of choice.
 </p>
 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a well-established analytical method for multi-elemental analysis for elements at trace- and ultra-trace levels. It is outstanding mainly due to the high sensitivity independent of the molecular structure of the analyte, wide linear dynamic range and due to excellent multi-element capabilities. In combination with laser ablation sample introduction, ICP-MS has also been used to image the distribution of metallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag) in single biological cells

 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As it was shown, NP-labelled antibodies in combination with ICP-MS used in dot-blot analysis are providing 4 orders of magnitude improved detection limits compared to standard metal-based labelling approach

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the first time, the combination of LA-ICP-MS with the technology of imprinted polymers is presented by application on the immunoassay using CdS quantum dots-labelled antibodies. By the technology of imprinted polymers (polydopamine), the analyte is selectively captured, and antibodies tagged by semiconductor NPs provided a high sensitivity signal. This proof-of-concept study combining for the first time the advantages of MIP and LA-ICP-MS is presented with special attention paid to optimization of the LA-ICP-MS method in terms of laser ablation parameters.</p>
