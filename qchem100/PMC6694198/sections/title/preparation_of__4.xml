 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">CdS QDs were prepared by mixing 50 μl Cd solution (3 mM) with 25 μl 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (Na

  <sub>4</sub>/NaH
  <sub>2</sub>PO

  <span class="sup">−1</span>) all 96 wells of UV-transparent well-plate. Then the plate was placed in UV trans-illuminator and was irradiated (λ = 254 nm) for 10 minutes. Resulted QDs were precipitated by 2-propanol (mixed 1:2 QDs:2-propanol, shaking for 10 minutes, and centrifugation for 10 min at 9000 rpm). Supernatant was removed and pellet was dried by solvent evaporation at 50 °C
