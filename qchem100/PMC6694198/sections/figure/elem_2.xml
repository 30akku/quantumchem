  <p>Schematic representation of two concepts of immunoassay combining QD-labelled antibodies and MIP technology. (
   <span class="bold">A</span>) 1-imprinting of the AG, 2-extraction of the AG from the sample by MIP, overlay with QD-AB conjugate, 3-interaction of the conjugate with the extracted AG from the sample, removal of the unreacted conjugate. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) 1 - imprinting of the complex QD-AB-AG, 2 - QD-AB-AG formed in the sample after addition of QD-AB conjugate into the sample solution and extraction of QD-AB-AG complex from the sample by MIP for removal of interferents from the sample. (
   <span class="bold">C</span>) Correlative Probe and Electron Microscopy (CPEM) imaging of MIP layer with imprinted QD-AB conjugate. 1 – SEM image, 2 - AFM image of the same area and sample in the same coordinate system. 3 – profile of a well formed due to the imprinting process.
