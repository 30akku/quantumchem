   <span class="bold">A</span>) Schematic representation of isolation and detection IgG from the same complex sample. At first the conjugate (QD-Ab) is added to the complex sample. The conjugate reacts with IgG contained in sample and creates the complex (QD-AB-AG) with them. The complex is bound to the cavity in MIP that is specific for this. The bound complex is subsequently detected by LA-ICP-MS. (B) ICP-MS signal intensities obtained by analysis of model protein mixture either with or without added IgG extracted by the assay schematically shown in (
