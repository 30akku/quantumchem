A non-covalent imprinting approach was employed in this study due to the simplicity of preparation. Simple oxidative polymerization of the dopamine that creates the self-assembly monolayer seems to be an ideal choice. The QDs prepared by UV light irradiation synthesis were stabilized by using mercaptosuccinic acid. Formation of a complex of QD-antibody and QD-antibody-antigen was verified by using capillary electrophoresis with laser-induced fluorescence detection. QDs and antibody were connected together <italic>via</italic> an affinity peptide linker. LA-ICP-MS was employed as a proof-of-concept for detection method of two types of immunoassay: 1) antigen extracted from the sample by MIP and subsequently overlaid/immunoreacted by QD-labelled antibodies, 2) complex of antigen, antibody, and QD formed in the sample and subsequently extracted by MIP. The first approach provided higher sensitivity (MIP/NIP), however, the second demonstrated higher selectivity.

It is based on a formation of an analyte recognition surface that is created after polymerization of a mixture of analyte and suitable monomer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Molecules or ions can be imprinted into polymers then molecularly or ion imprinted polymers (MIP or IIP, respectively) are formed. Nowadays, MIPs are used as specific selectors for pre-concentration of broad groups of analytes in food<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, beverages<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>, water<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>, soil<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>, and biological samples (e.g. blood plasma<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>). The main benefit of this technology is in its variability. Compared to conventional immunoassay, the use of MIP technology is applicable for analytes for which the antibodies are unavailable. Moreover, MIPs can be employed for a broad range of analytes (from ions to microorganisms) and take advantage of various surface arrangements (well-plates, microscopic slides, mass spectrometric targets, electrode and/or even nanoparticle surfaces). The monomer/polymer system can be also varied to provide not only suitable functional groups increasing the specificity of the interaction with the target analyte, but also suitable polymerization conditions<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Moreover, a number of detection techniques (e.g., fluorescence spectrometry or microscopy, mass spectrometry, and/or quartz crystal microbalance) can be selected. The most commonly employed type of detection method is probably the quartz crystal microbalance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>, however extremely sensitive techniques such as inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) may provide benefits for certain applications<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">One of the polymers used for MIPs is polydopamine offering numerous benefits compared methacrylate and its derivatives<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Polydopamine was used for the first time as a surface coating in 2007 by Lee <italic>et al</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and since then, the benefits of this material have been exploited in various fields including molecular imprinting<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Simple oxidative polymerization of dopamine is involved during the formation of the self-assembly layer<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref></sup>. Even though the detail mechanism of the polymerization is still not completely clear, it has been widely to create MIP on surfaces such as particles<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, monolithic columns<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup> and/or carbon nanomaterials<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par4">MIPs have found its application in biochemistry and bioanalysis providing an alternative to antibodies used in immunoassays. Standard immunoassays are commonly visualized by optical techniques, such as fluorescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>, chemi(bio)luminescence<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>, colorimetric detection<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup> or more recently introduced photothermal method<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>, however in some cases, a more sensitive detection is required. For such applications, metal-labelled antibodies in combination with laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) is the method of choice.</p><p id="Par5">Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) is a well-established analytical method for multi-elemental analysis for elements at trace- and ultra-trace levels. It is outstanding mainly due to the high sensitivity independent of the molecular structure of the analyte, wide linear dynamic range and due to excellent multi-element capabilities. In combination with laser ablation sample introduction, ICP-MS has also been used to image the distribution of metallic nanoparticles (Au, Ag) in single biological cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par6">As it was shown, NP-labelled antibodies in combination with ICP-MS used in dot-blot analysis are providing 4 orders of magnitude improved detection limits compared to standard metal-based labelling approach<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup>.

Similarly, when the complex QD-HWR-AB-AG was created (after addition of AG in total concentration 0.026&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), further increase in migration time was observed (4.32&#x02009;minutes). Moreover, significant increase in the fluorescence intensity is observed when the HWR peptide is connected to CdS QDs. It is supposed that the increase relates to the fluorescence resonance energy transfer occurring within the formed complex. HWR peptide contains 1 molecule of histidine with an aromatic ring responsible for absorption maximum at 390&#x02009;nm<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref></sup>. Hence the light supplied by the excitation LED was absorbed by the histidine and transferred to the connected QD. This is believed to lead to the fluorescence signal enhancement. However this was not the aim of this study and therefore, it was not further investigated in detail.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Electropherogram recording consequent complex formation by CE-LIF.

The concentration of 16&#x02009;mM (2.5&#x02009;mg&#x02009;ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) dopamine hydrochloride was determined as the most effective considering the imprinting ratio (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Optimization of ablation parameters</title><p id="Par22">Laser ablation parameters as the laser beam fluence, laser spot size and scan speed were optimized to get a combination of both parameters with high sensitivity and high stability (low relative standard deviation - RSD) of the measured signal of <sup>111</sup>Cd. For all optimization, the slide was covered by a layer of polydopamine surface imprinted with CdS QDs with a diameter of 18&#x02009;nm. First, optimization of laser beam fluence and laser spot size was carried out. Laser ablation system operates in 2 modes of laser beam focusing: I) Imaging mode &#x02013; the laser spot size selected by using suitable aperture and II) Focused mode &#x02013; the laser spot size selected by moving the lens. In the case of the imaging mode, the laser beam energy was more homogeneous across the laser beam cross section than in case of the Focused mode. To get the highest amount of the ablated material the largest available laser beam diameters for each focusing mode were tested &#x02013; 110 (imaging) and 250 &#x003bc;m (focused). The laser beam fluence was changed in a range from 0.5 to 6.0&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. Under optimal laser beam fluence and laser spot size, the optimization of scan speed was done. Each combination of laser spot size and laser beam fluence was done as a line scan in triplicates on different places on the slide. The arithmetic average and relative standard deviations were calculated. The results of the optimization of laser beam spot size and fluence are summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> The pink and blue columns represent the laser beam diameters of 110 and 250 &#x003bc;m, respectively. As expected, the 250 &#x003bc;m laser beam spot provided significantly higher intensities compared to the 110 &#x003bc;m laser beam. In the case of the signal stability, the results obtained by 250 &#x003bc;m laser beam spot exhibited lower RSD compared to 110 &#x003bc;m laser beam spot. Hence, the laser beam spot of 250 &#x003bc;m was selected as optimal. Once the laser beam fluence was optimized, the largest intensities were achieved for 4 and 6&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup>. However, the lower stability of the signal was obtained. Therefore, the laser beam fluence of 2&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup> was used as a compromise between the signal sensitivity and stability.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Influence of laser beam diameters (110 and 250 &#x003bc;m) and fluence (0.5, 2, 4, and 6&#x02009;J/cm<sup>2</sup>) on intensity of <sup>111</sup>Cd signal.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_48290_Fig2_HTML" id="d29e680"/></fig></p><p id="Par23">Subsequently, the optimal scan speed was searched.

The RSD of the signal intensity varied from 10 to 15% for all 4 tested scan speeds (300, 800, 1200 and 2000 &#x003bc;m/s). Hence, the criterion for selection of scan speed was the duration of the analysis.

In the first concept (concept labelled A), only the AG was used as a template and therefore, the MIP selective only for AG was prepared.

The MIP/NIP signal ratio was 13.5 and 3.4 for concept A and concept B, respectively. This result, however demonstrates the concept A to be less influenced by the non-specific adsorption of the sample components on the polymeric layer (NIP signal).<fig id="Fig4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>ICP-MS signal intensities (MIPs and NIPs) obtained by analysis of IgG standard sample by assay concepts A and B described in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="41598_2019_48290_Fig4_HTML" id="d29e735"/></fig></p><p id="Par28">Lower intensities (both MIP and NIP) are observed in concept A compared to concept B. This is probably due to the fact that when the concept A is applied, the antigen only is imprinted, but its orientation in the polydopamine layer may not always be correct; that means, when the antigen is oriented so that the interaction site is not accessible for the QD-labelled antibody, the antigen-antibody interaction is prevented.</p><p id="Par29">On the other hand, the concept B is providing 2.9-fold higher MIP signal compared to concept A suggesting better sensitivity of this approach. The significantly higher NIP signal (11.6-fold) of B concept compared to approach A is probably given by the fact that some mole-cules of AA-QD complex are more prone to non-specific adsorption.</p><p id="Par30">The LODs of both concepts were calculated according to 3 &#x003c3;: concept A &#x02013; 4.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, concept B &#x02013; 1.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g.</p><p id="Par31">NIP is prepared under identical conditions and also with identical construction as MIP. The difference is that NIP is prepared without the presence of the template. It is taken as an indicator of non-specific binding. The NIP has functional groups randomly arranged on its surface that interact with analyte and cause to some extent bindings. These non-specific bindings are weaker than those of the MIP. The difference in binding to the MIP and the NIP are caused by selective binding sites in MIP created by imprinting of template molecule<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref></sup>. On the surface of NIP, monomer self-association occurs and reduces the number of free functional groups where the analyte can be bound. Therefore NIP is able to bound less amount of analyte.</p><p id="Par32">Based on the above mentioned facts, concept B was evaluated as more sensitive as it yields in lower LOD and therefore, was used for isolation and detection of IgG from complex model sample. For this purpose, the protein ladder was used. It consists of mixture of proteins in range from 10&#x02013;180&#x02009;kDa (lysozyme, &#x003b1;-lactalbumin, trypsin inhibitor, carbonic anhydrase, ovalbumin, bovine serum albumin, phosphorylase B, &#x003b2;-galactosidase; 0.1&#x02013;0.3&#x02009;mg/ml each). Scheme of experiment is illustrated in the Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5A</xref>. The idea of this experiment is that the conjugate QD-AB-AG (QD-antiIgG-IgG) is imprinted. Then the QD-AB (QD-antiIgG) conjugate is added into the solution of protein ladder and the AG (IgG) from the sample is captured forming QD-AB-AG (QD-antiIgG-IgG) conjugate. After the overlay of the MIP by this solution, QD-antiIgG-IgG conjugate is captured in the cavities and interfering proteins are washed.<fig id="Fig5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of isolation and detection IgG from the same complex sample. At first the conjugate (QD-Ab) is added to the complex sample. The conjugate reacts with IgG contained in sample and creates the complex (QD-AB-AG) with them. The complex is bound to the cavity in MIP that is specific for this. The bound complex is subsequently detected by LA-ICP-MS.

The addition of IgG was 2.5&#x02009;&#x003bc;g. The mixture of proteins and the QD-AB conjugate was mixed in ratio 1:1. The results are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5B</xref>. It is clearly seen that mixture without IgG addition produces the signal intensity indistinguishable from the NIP, which is due to the nonspecific adsorption. However, it is impossible to distinguish whether the sample components are or the QD-AB conjugate are nonspecifically adsorbed on MIP surface. While after the addition of IgG a significant increase of Cd intensity relating to presence of QD-antiIgG-IgG conjugate is observed. It means that the Concept B is able to isolate IgG from the complex sample containing a mixture of proteins. In comparison results for concept B from Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref> significantly lower sensitivity and higher LOD was found. This deterioration of the parameters is caused probably due to the matrix effect of the proteins present in the sample.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec18" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par34">The MIP technology is currently experiencing a rapid development due to the limitations of natural recognition elements such antibodies or aptamers. However, neither MIP strategies are limitless. Therefore, the combination of these powerful tools in a specific immunoassay may bring highly selective approach. In this work, a MIP-based pseudo-immunoassay using NP-labelled antibody recognition was introduced and coupled with the sensitive detection technique &#x02013; LA-ICP-MS. Two approaches of specific recognition were tested. The first one was based on the immunolabelling of the analyte captured by the MIP layer. The second approach involved immunolabelling of the analyte as a first step and the resulting QD-AB-AG complex was captured by MIP and further analyzed.</p><p id="Par35">The double-selective approach comprising of the specific immunolabelling reaction combined with isolation by MIP together with the LA-ICP-MS detection represents a viable approach of the IgG detection from a complex sample (LOD 4.2&#x02009;&#x003bc;g and 1.6&#x02009;&#x003bc;g, respectively) available for many exciting applications. Considering the overall time of the LA-ICP-MS analysis not exceeding 23&#x02009;s (scan speed of 2000 &#x003bc;m/s), LA-ICP-MS is a promising technology to be used in future in conjunction with MIP technology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary information</title><sec id="Sec19"><p>
