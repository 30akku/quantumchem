   <span class="bold">a</span> Schematic illustrating the authentication process: 1: image capture and database generation from the goods by the manufacturers, 2: image learning by AI, 3: Image capture from the goods by the consumers using their smart phones, 4: image recognition and comparing by AI, and 5: authentication outcome feedback to the consumers. 
   <span class="bold">b</span>–
   <span class="bold">g</span> A library of six single dot pattern security labels, 
   <span class="bold">h</span>–
   <span class="bold">m</span> six fluorescence images taken from 
   <span class="bold">b</span> (referred as to genuine product) with different brightness, sharpness, rotation angles, magnifications, and the mixture of the above-mentioned factors, and 
   <span class="bold">n</span>–
   <span class="bold">s</span> six fluorescence images from security labels that are not in the database shown in panel 
   <span class="bold">b</span>–
   <span class="bold">g</span> (referred as to fake products). 
   <span class="bold">t</span>, 
   <span class="bold">u</span> Recognition rates of labels (h1–h6) and (i1–i6) by the authenticating way of deep learning. Labels (g1–g6), (h1–h6), and (i1–i6) correspond to the labels in figure (
   <span class="bold">b</span>–
   <span class="bold">g</span>), (
   <span class="bold">h</span>–
   <span class="bold">m</span>), and (
   <span class="bold">n</span>–
   <span class="bold">s</span>) respectively. The color scales from blue to red stand for the matching score (ranging from 0 to 100%) of the captured pictures with the labels
