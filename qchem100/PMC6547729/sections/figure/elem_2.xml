  <p>Security labels with physically unclonble flower-like patterns. Typical fluorescence images of inkjet-printed macroscopic letters FZU composed of 
   <span class="bold">a</span> red, 
   <span class="bold">b</span> green, and 
   <span class="bold">c</span> blue emission dot patterns (the scale bar is 4000 μm), 
   <span class="bold">d</span>–

   <span class="bold">g</span>–
   <span class="bold">i</span> further enlarged images (the scale bar is 100 μm). All the samples are printed under the same conditions. The FZU patterns are identical on macroscale but completely different at the microscale (i.e., every dot pattern is unique)
