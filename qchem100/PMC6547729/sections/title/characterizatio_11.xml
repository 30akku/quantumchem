 <p id="Par22" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The surface morphology of the PMMA films and quantum-dot patterns were characterized with atomic force microscopy (AFM, Bruker Multimode 8) and scanning electronic microscope (SEM, FEI, Nova Nano SEM 230). The UV−Vis absorption spectra were tested with a UV/Vis/NIR spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-3600). The transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) image of quantum dots was recorded using JEOL JEM-2100F microscope. The steady-state photoluminescence (PL) spectra were collected with a Hitachi F-4600 fluorescence spectrophotometer, by exciting the samples using a Xe lamp coupled with a monochromator. Time-resolved PL measurement was collected by using fluorescence lifetime measurement system (HORIBA scientific). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 50 FTIR spectrometer at room temperature. The PL microscopic images of quantum dot patterns morphology were characterized by using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus BX51M). For pattern readout with a smartphone microscope, the portable microscope was linked to a small WiFi box by a USB line, which allows for the smartphone to control the microscope for real-time imaging (see Supplementary Fig.
