 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ideal fluorescent security labels require the ink materials having strong fluorescence intensity, which guarantees the high fluorescence brightness. The prepared quantum dot inks exhibit a narrow fluorescence emission peak with maximum intensity at 459 nm, 532 nm, and 631 nm, respectively, when excited at 375 nm (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a</a>). The full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of these blue, green and red emission quantum dots is 20 nm, 24 nm, and 28 nm, respectively. They also bear a high fluorescence quantum yield of 75, 90, and 80%, respectively. The time-resolved fluorescence decays of the blue, green, and red emission quantum dots show their lifetime of 27.5 ns, 17.0 ns, and 7.6 ns (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>), respectively, in consistent with consistent with previous reports

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complex Fuzhou University logos composed of red, green, or blue emission arrays were inkjet-printed on indium tin oxide (ITO) coated glass slides using the printing strategy described in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. The print substrates with Fuzhou University logos maintained transparent (Insert of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). That is, the inkjet-printed logos are invisible by naked eyes under the ambient conditions. The transmittance curves of the printed ITO glass slides are almost identical to the pristine print substrate (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>), further confirming the covert characteristic of the fabricated security labels. When irradiated with UV light, bright red, green and blue photoluminescence photographs of the university logos were observed by the naked eyes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d–f</a>). Any other 2D macroscale patterns with sharp corners, for example, QR codes and bar codes (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2g–i</a>), can also be produced using our inkjet printing technique. The property that these images are only seen upon UV excitation offers the first layer of security realized by naked eye authentication of macroscopic patterns; and the PUF nature of the flower-like patterns is the second more secure layer.

 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By tuning RGB ink component ratios, fine tonal variations from red to green were obtained (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">9</a>). In principle, the full palette of colors could be achieved with elaborate control of the RGB ink components. Alternatively, the full-color security labels can be generated by creating individual color pixels including red, green, and blue sub-pixels, which has been widely used in display

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a>). Although the 2D macroscale security labels shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d-i</a> contained thousands of discrete points (or pixels), the printing process is completed within a few minutes using our single-nozzle printing machine.

 <p id="Par12" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Figure 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> displays fluorescence micrographs of three batches of inkjet-printed macroscopic letters FZU (i.e., the acronym of Fuzhou University) that are composed of red, green, or blue emission arrays. At the macroscopic level, the printed FZU letters were seemingly identical (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a–c</a>). However, under the microscopic level, they were completely different from each other, as every fluorescent pixel of the letters showed a unique, random and unrepeatable flower-like geometry (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3d–i</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">11</a>). Further scanning electron microscope and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy characterizations verify that the unique flower-like micropattern obtained from optical imaging systems is consistent with quantum dot deposition zones (see Supplementary Figs. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>2–
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">14</a>). By carefully comparing all the pixels within the letters (i.e., the same sample), no identical flower-like micropatterns were found. A copy of the red, green, and blue fluorescence counterparts of the FZU letters shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> fabricated under the same conditions also shows entirely different geometries of the corresponding pixels (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">15</a>). The encoding capacity of the inkjet-printed security labels that relies on the encoding capacity (defined as l) and the number (defined as m) of the PUF patterns (i.e., flower-like pixels) within the security labels can be described as l
  <span class="sup">m</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. Recently, Carro-Temboury et al. established a universal binary-bit model for the estimation of the encoding capacity of PUF pattern
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. According to Carro-Temboury’s model, the encoding capacity of a red flower-like PUF pattern, l, is calculated to be 4.7 × 10
  <span class="sup">202</span> (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>6 and Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a> for calculation details). Therefore, for a security label composed of 1000 red flower-like PUF patterns, its encoding capacity will be larger than 10
  <span class="sup">202,000</span>. This indicates that the inkjet-printed security labels are unclonable even by the manufacturer. Moreover, the fabricated security labels have been frequently exposed to UV light over the period of 2 months. No obvious decrease of the fluorescence brightness is observed, revealing that security labels have excellent chemical and photo stabilities (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">17</a>).
