 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Counterfeiting and forgery is a global problem that causes significant financial damage and poses security threats to individuals, companies, and society as a whole

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,

  </span>. Over the past decades, counterfeit products have spread from daily consumer goods, to medicines and high-tech products
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. Although majority of the products are protected by an anti-counterfeiting technique, the global economic loss of counterfeiting has been increasing annually and estimated to reach 1.7 trillion US dollars in 2015
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. The reason for this is the currently used anti-counterfeiting technologies that rely on inkjet-printed security labels can be readily duplicated by counterfeiters due to their uniform patterns and predicable, deterministic decoding mechanisms

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Despite this, the inkjet-printing technique itself has many distinguished advantages in low production cost, mass production, material-effective utility, unlimited pattern design ability, and excellent compatibility with various ink materials as well as supporting substrates

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Security labels with physical unclonable functions (PUFs) could offer a practical solution to the limitation of the widely used anti-counterfeiting technologies and seem to be the most viable path to combat the increasingly serious global forgery issue
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. A PUF is a physical object with an intrinsic, unique, random physical feature generated in a non-deterministic process
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20" href="#CR20">20</a>
  </span>. The randomness characteristic of the feature guarantees unreplicable code outputs. To date, a significant progress in PUF encryption has been made in the anti-counterfeiting field, mainly focusing on generating random features composed of either rough surfaces

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span> within the predefined pattern areas. For example, Bae et al. has demonstrated the use of randomly wrinkling silica-coated polymeric particles as PUF codes to produce unique artificial fingerprints for anti-counterfeiting applications
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. Our group recently have utilized advantage of electrostatic self-assembly strategy to generate randomly arranged plasmonic (metal) arrays as PUF codes using fluorescein-doped silver-silica core-shell nanoparticles as building blocks, giving rise to multi-optical signal encoded, unclonable security labels
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span>. However, the creation of well-defined two-dimensional (2D) graphic security labels that carry PUF codes requires the aid of expensive lithography techniques. Moreover, the decryption of such PUF-based security labels relies on a machine learning pattern recognition and comparison analysis that a real fingerprinting does
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>. The machine learning authentication technique only focuses on algorithms for pattern recognition and enhancement to extract the PUF codes.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we develop an inkjet-printable, artificial intelligence (AI) decodable, unclonable, fluorescence security label by combining the advantages of inkjet printing, portable smart-phone microscopes and AI technique. The security labels with diverse pattern designs are fabricated through inkjet printing using II-VI semiconductor core-shell quantum dots as model ink. The surface decoration of print substrates, such as glass, plastic, or paper, with randomly distributed poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) nanoparticles is critical for the successful inkjet printing of unclonable security labels. The polymer nanoparticles on the substrates are acted as stochastic pinning points at the three-phase contact lines of the ink droplets. Upon the solvent evaporation, the three-phase contact lines are pinned around the pinning points. The quantum dots in the ink droplets subsequently deposit on the pinning points, forming physically unclonable flower-like dot patterns (i.e., primary units for any 2D logos). The designed surface modification makes the security labels (i.e., 2D logos) unique and unclonable. By utilizing red, green and blue (RGB) emission semiconductor quantum dots, full-color pictures can be generated, which are invisible in the ambient environment. The fabricated security labels seem to be the same from batch to batch on the macroscopic level; however, at the microscopic level, they are quite different from each other. Compared with previous reports using the intrinsic surface topography of a material (e.g., scratch patterns, fiber weave, etc.) for PUF encoding

  </span>, the system presented here has many advantages: (1) the developed printing strategy for the security label fabrication not only allows for various pattern design but also makes the mass-production at low cost possible; (2) the quantum dot ink is fluorescence active, guaranteeing the readout signals from suffering the interference by fingerprints and dusts; (3) the quantum dot security labels are only visible upon UV excitation, which offers the first layer of security, while the PUF nature originated from the random flower-like dot patterns provides the second more secure layer; (4) the first layer of security can be easily authenticated with naked eyes, while the second layer of security is able to be authenticated with AI technique rather than time-consuming machine learning algorithms. Moreover, we introduce AI (specifically deep learning) security label authentication concept and succeed in accurately and robustly decoding the unrepeatable flower-like dot patterns with different focusing degrees, brightness, rotation angles, amplification factors and the mixture of these parameters. The developed anti-counterfeiting technology meets all the requirements for commercial applications that are low cost, mass-producible, nondestructive, diverse full-color pattern design capability, unclonable, and convenient for authentication.
