 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For geometry optimization, the energy gradients of Hamiltonians, wavefunctions, and DFT formulations are required to evaluate the forces at the nuclei. The analytical gradients of NR, SF‐IODKH/NR, SF‐LUT‐IODKH/NR, and SD‐LUT‐IODKH/NR, as well as the numerical gradients for all of the Hamiltonians, are available in RAQET. The LUT analytical scheme is the default option for the calculations because it requires considerably less computational time than conventional 2c relativistic Hamiltonians
