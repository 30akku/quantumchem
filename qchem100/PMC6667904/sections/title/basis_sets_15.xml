 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">RAQET has a basis set database for the easy preparation of input files. This contains various basis sets optimized for both NR and 2c relativistic calculations. For example, the NR basis sets contain STO‐types such as STO‐3G and STO‐6G, Pople‐types such as 6‐31G and 6‐311G(d), Dunning‐types such as cc‐pVDZ and aug‐cc‐pVTZ, and Sapporo‐types such as Sapporo‐DZP and Sapporo‐TZP+d. The relativistic basis sets contain cc‐pVDZ‐DK, Sapporo‐DKH3‐DZP, SARC‐DKH, DKH3‐Gen‐TK/NOSec‐V‐TZP, and ANO‐RCC. Furthermore, users can manually add new basis sets to the database. The details of the available basis sets are summarized in the
