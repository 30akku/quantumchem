 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to maximize induced heating, SPIONs with high specific absorption rates (SAR) (Sigma Aldrich #900042, St. Louis, MO, USA) were used. According to their material safety data sheets, the components of these particles (aside from their iron oxide content) include maleic anhydride polymer with methoxyethane and water [
  <a rid="B34-ijms-20-03190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijms-20-03190">34</a>]. The rate of hydrolysis, prior to laboratory use, of the maleic anhydride to maleic acid is unknown. Thus, we subjected the particles to a rigorous washing in effort to maximize the conversion.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The particle stock solution was first diluted to a working concentration of 0.5 mg/mL, mixed with deionized water, and 190 proof ethanol as a mutual solvent, to a final ratio of 1 part particles, 2 parts water, and 7 parts ethano. The resulting mixture was then heated under reflux conditions for a period of 8 h. Verification of hydrolysis was confirmed via on the NICOLET 6700 FTIR-ATR apparatus (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).</p>
