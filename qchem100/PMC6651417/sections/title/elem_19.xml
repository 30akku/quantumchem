  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to test the magnetic activation of the latent TGF-β, an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) specific to active TGF-β was used, following the manufacturer’s procedure (Duoset
   <span class="sup">®</span>, R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA). The results were measured via a UV/Vis spectrophotometer (PERKIN-ELMER LAMBDA 800, (Waltham, MA, USA), with absorbance measured at 450 nm. In order to correct for optical imperfections within the plate, absorbance was measured at 540 and 570 nm and subtracted from the 450 absorbance measurement. From the correlation of optical density to protein concentration, a standard curve was created.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Following the conjugation of latent TGF-β to magnetic nanoparticles, magnetic activation by way of magnetic hyperthermia was attempted. First, the particles were magnetically separated and resuspended in PBS. The particles were then split into two groups. The first group was designated for magnetic release. This sub-group would undergo magnetic hyperthermia in a radio frequency alternating magnetic field using an Ambrell Easy Heat (
   <span class="italic">f</span> = 350 kHz/H = 40 kA/m) apparatus (Rochester, NY, USA). The second sub-group was used as a control, wherein the samples were kept at room temperature, away from the presence of an alternating magnetic field. For each group, three samples were tested via ELISA, using the given protocol. A two-tailed, unpaired homoscedastic t-test was performed in order to determine significance.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It became necessary to verify the integrity of the latent TGF-β, and to test whether or not it was possible to release the active TGF-β from the small latent complex using only heat. To this end, latent TGF-β was split into two groups: an experimental group that would be heated on an AccuBlock Digital Dry Bath (Labnet International, Inc., USA) at 80 °C for 10 min, and a control group kept at room temperature. The resulting release of active TGF-β was then quantified via ELISA.</p>
