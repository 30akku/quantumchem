 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hydrolyzed SPIONs were diluted to a concentration of 0.5 mg/mL. A total 20 mg of both NHS and EDC were added, and the solution was left to incubate for 1 h before the particles underwent magnetic separation. After magnetic separation, the supernatant was decanted and the particles were washed with deionized water. This wash step was repeated three times before the particles were resuspended in PBS and latent TGF-Î² (2.5 ng/mL) was added. The solution was left to incubate for 1 h before the particles underwent magnetic separation and were washed three times with a PBS solution, wherein the pH was raised to 9 via dropwise addition of NaOH. The particles were washed with pH 9 PBS three times, after which they were resuspended and stored in pH 7 PBS. These wash steps were found to be necessary in order to properly quench the EDC/NHS reaction without altering any existing functional groups, thereby maintaining the integrity of the protein.</p>
