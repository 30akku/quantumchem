 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TGF-β was successfully conjugated to SPIONs using carbodiimide chemistry. Through this research, we have successfully shown the ability to noninvasively transfer energy from a magnetic field to the SPION, triggering the release of active TGF-β from the latent complex. Future studies will require optimization of this technique in order to minimize the background release. Furthermore, we will investigate magneto-mechanical activation strategies in future studies.</p>
