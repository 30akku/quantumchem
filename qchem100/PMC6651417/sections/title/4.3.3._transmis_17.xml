 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) imaging of the particles was performed using a FEI Tecnai F20 transmission electron microscope operated at 200 kV and equipped with a Gatan UltraScan 1000P digital camera (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Specimens for HR-TEM imaging were prepared by drop casting the particles suspended in PBS onto Cu grids with a &lt;2 nm thick C film supported by a thicker, lacy C film (Ted Pella #01824, (Redding, CA, USA), and allowing the grids to dry in air on a warm hotplate. All HR-TEM imaging was performed on particles located on unsupported (&lt;2 nm thick) regions of the C film to minimize the distortion to the images resulting from the presence of the film.</p>
