If we assume that this film is made of latent TGF-β, then this suggests that the EDC/NHS conjugation reaction effectively crosslinked the nanoparticles. The conversion of maleic anhydride to maleic acid frees up two units of carboxylic acids that are primed for use by carbodiimide conjugation, the density of the surface species, maleic acid, would dictate the degree of binding availability for the protein to be bound to. TGF-β has multiple binding domains available for carbodiimide conjugation chemistry to occur. Thus, the free TGF-β that may have already reacted with one magnetic nanoparticle may yet still react with another magnetic nanoparticle, or even with another protein. This is likely the cause of the aggregation seen in
