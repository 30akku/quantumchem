 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It became necessary to verify the integrity of the latent TGF-β, and to test whether or not it was possible to release the active TGF-β from the small latent complex using only heat. To this end, latent TGF-β was split into two groups: an experimental group that would be heated on an AccuBlock Digital Dry Bath (Labnet International, Inc., USA) at 80 °C for 10 min, and a control group kept at room temperature. The resulting release of active TGF-β was then quantified via ELISA.</p>
