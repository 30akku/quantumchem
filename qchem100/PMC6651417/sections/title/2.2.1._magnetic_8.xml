 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results indicate a statistically significant (
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) increase in the release of active TGF-β from the samples that underwent magnetic hyperthermia, compared to the background release seen in the control. However, the high background release of the control group indicates that either the alternating magnetic field, sample handling, or the carbodiimide crosslinking itself may have led to some release of active TGF-β from the SLC.
