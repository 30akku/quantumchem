 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Liquid samples were placed upright in a lateral magnetic separator (Dobson Laboratory, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA) until the separated magnetic nanoparticles gathered on the lateral side of each upright Eppendorf pipette tube ( Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). After separation, the supernatants were decanted and the particles were resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (PBS). This wash was repeated three times. Prior to use of FTIR-ATR, the particles were sonicated for 10 min in order to ensure a homogenous suspension. A 10 uL aliquot was taken and dried by heating and placed onto the NICOLET 6700 detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). No further preparation was needed, since FTIR-ATR only requires dried-solid samples. A background of air was taken before measurements, and isopropanol was used to clean the detector between samples.</p>
