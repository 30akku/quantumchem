 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Both experimental and control groups (100 ÂµL of particles in suspension) were collected into PTFE sample holders and placed into the quantum design magnetic property measurement system 3 (superconducting quantum inference device (MPMS-3-SQUID San Diego, CA, USA). Magnetization curves for each group were obtained at room temperature. By fitting the magnetization curve to the Langevin function [
  <a rid="B34-ijms-20-03190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-ijms-20-03190">34</a>], it is possible to determine the magnetic diameter as well as the geometric deviation; doing this relies on the assumption that the magnetic domains are spherical, as well as the assumption that said magnetic domains possess a magnetization equivalent to bulk magnetite (86.6 emu/g) [
  <a rid="B35-ijms-20-03190" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-ijms-20-03190">35</a>]. We also deduced the saturation magnetization by measuring the maximum magnetization on the magnetization curves [
