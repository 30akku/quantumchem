  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f004" href="#ijms-20-03190-f004">Figure 4</a>A indicate that the particles were superparamagnetic and retained their superparamagnetic properties after conjugation. In 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f004" href="#ijms-20-03190-f004">Figure 4</a>B, the two groups shared similar volume fractions, as expected. This suggests an accurate Lavange-Chantrell model. Notably, the results shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f004" href="#ijms-20-03190-f004">Figure 4</a>B also indicate that there was no observable decrease in saturation magnetization caused by the conjugation of the magnetic nanoparticles, though further studies are required to verify the statistical significance of this observation. Interestingly enough, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f004" href="#ijms-20-03190-f004">Figure 4</a>B also indicates that the conjugated particles exhibited an increase in magnetic diameter. The magnetic diameter obtained from the Chantrell model often differs from a particleâ€™s physical diameter. Thus, it does not necessarily follow that an increase in physical diameter should also lead to an increase in magnetic diameter, especially when that increase is due to the conjugation of a nominally diamagnetic protein. As such, further investigation into this matter is needed.
