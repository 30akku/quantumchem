The unimodal distribution does not point to aggregation of the particles, but rather to a change in the particle’s hydrodynamic radius. One possible explanation could be the increase of hydrodynamic radius by the ring opening conversion of maleic anhydride to maleic acid, which represents the converted surface species on the magnetic nanoparticles. The additional carboxyl groups are then additionally stabilized and solvated by Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), which would be the most likely case for the shift in distribution but retention of unimodality.
