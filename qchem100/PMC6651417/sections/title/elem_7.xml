  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Results indicate a statistically significant (
   <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.001) increase in the release of active TGF-β from the samples that underwent magnetic hyperthermia, compared to the background release seen in the control. However, the high background release of the control group indicates that either the alternating magnetic field, sample handling, or the carbodiimide crosslinking itself may have led to some release of active TGF-β from the SLC.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ELISA specific to active TGF-β was run with samples at room temperature versus samples heated at 55 °C for a period for 1 h, and samples heated at 80 °C for 10 min. As shown by 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f005" href="#ijms-20-03190-f005">Figure 5</a>a, the bulk temperature of the sample reached as high as 55 °C during magnetic induction. However, heating at 55 °C for a period of 1 h was not enough to cause a significant increase in the release of active TGF-β from the latent complex when compared to the negative control of latent TGF-β left at room temperature, as shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f005" href="#ijms-20-03190-f005">Figure 5</a>b. Instead, temperature must exceed 80 °C in order to show a significant amount of release.
