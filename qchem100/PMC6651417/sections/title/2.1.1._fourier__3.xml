 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">FTIR analysis showed a peak at ~1700 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> that is representative of a carbonyl carbon belonging to a carboxylic acid functional group (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f001" href="#ijms-20-03190-f001">Figure 1</a>). When comparing the pre-conjugation particles to the post-conjugation particles, this peak is replaced by the dual peaks at ~1550cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and ~1650 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, as well as a new peak at ~3300 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The peaks at 1550 and 3300 are mostly representative of an N–H bond found in an amide group. The peak at 1650 is mostly representative of a carbonyl carbon attached to an amine in an amide bond.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Taken together, the loss of the carboxylic acid functional group and the gaining of an amide bond strongly suggest that the conjugation between the magnetic nanoparticle and the protein by way of EDC/NHS, was successful. Furthermore, these results are consistent across multiple different proteins, which suggests that FTIR is a reliable method for testing conjugation chemistry.</p>
