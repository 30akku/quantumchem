 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An ELISA specific to active TGF-β was run with samples at room temperature versus samples heated at 55 °C for a period for 1 h, and samples heated at 80 °C for 10 min. As shown by 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f005" href="#ijms-20-03190-f005">Figure 5</a>a, the bulk temperature of the sample reached as high as 55 °C during magnetic induction. However, heating at 55 °C for a period of 1 h was not enough to cause a significant increase in the release of active TGF-β from the latent complex when compared to the negative control of latent TGF-β left at room temperature, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijms-20-03190-f005" href="#ijms-20-03190-f005">Figure 5</a>b. Instead, temperature must exceed 80 °C in order to show a significant amount of release.
