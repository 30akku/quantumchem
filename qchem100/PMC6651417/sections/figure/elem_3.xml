  <p>(
   <span class="bold">A</span>) Superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) magnetometer magnetization curves for the magnetic nanoparticles. Green is the control group (particles and protein but lacking in EDC), with saturation magnetization of 2.9 kA/m, whereas blue is the experimental group (particles conjugated to protein), with saturation magnetization of 3.1 kA/m. (
   <span class="bold">B</span>) Table depicting Langevin fit model. K0 (temperature) and K1 (magnetization of magnetite) are held variables. K2 is volume fraction, K3 is magnetic diameter, K4 is the geometric deviation, and K5 is the high field slope. Also shown in the table are the number of passes before fit, the chi square of the fit denoting error, and the saturation magnetization.
