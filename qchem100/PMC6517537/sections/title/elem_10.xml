   <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence spectroscopy has been mostly used in the investigation of molecular interactions between ligands and proteins. The variety of parameters related to binding mechanism of antidepressant drugs with serum albumins have been investigated by means of fluorescence measurements. Serum albumins have three intrinsic fluorophores residues tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phen) 
    <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">[43]</a>. Generally, the Trp alone contribute to intrinsic fluorescence, because Phen has a very low quantum yield and the fluorescence of Tyr get completely quenched when ionized. Therefore, the fluorescence of BSA and HSA regularly decreases with increasing concentration of drugs but does not show any significant shift of the emission at maximum wavelength. The fluorescence spectra of BSA and HSA with varying concentration of antidepressant drugs are shown in

Consequently, the CDs caused a stronger complex to be established. The interaction behavior of SA-drug changed with the presence of CDs in the ternary systems at λex = 280 nm was higher than at λex = 295 nm, because at λex = 280 nm both Tyr and Trp were excited, whereas at λex = 295 nm only Trp was excited.

Dynamic quenching represents from collision encounters between fluorophore and quencher, whereas quenching by formation of a complex between quencher and fluorophore predating excitation shows the static quenching. The quenching mechanism of serum albumins with drugs is static in nature. It shows the fluorescence intensity of BSA and HSA remains constant with increasing drug concentration because drug can bind to the HSA and BSA [

  <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment was conducted with particles dispersed and size distribution during the assembly of CDs-SA-Drug. The variation in size, scattering intensities observed for antidepressant drugs and CDs. Particle size distribution was found in the range of 1–1000 nm. The results from DLS measurements showed that the size (diameter) of the nanohybrids did not change with the increasing number of serum albumins per CDs and antidepressant drugs, upon addition of various molar ratio of SA-antidepressant drugs. DLS determinations showed that the negative surface charge of the quantum dots neutralized upon adsorption of the serum albumin and drug. Generally, the ζ-potential of CDs was reduced when SA-drug were bond that the surface, further increase of the drug concentration did not lead to significant changes in the DLS as shown in 
   <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. Moreover, the data revealed that the nanohybrid is a complex between CDs and protein which were formed due to electrostatic interactions of the negatively charged CDs and the cationic “hot spot” around the active site of SA antidepressant drugs. It also revealed the exact amount of SA-antidepressant drugs adsorbed over each CDs.
