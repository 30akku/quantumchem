 <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the present work, the binding of antidepressant drugs (AMT, CPZ, DSP) to serum albumins (BSA/HSA) were carried out by employing spectroscopic techniques under physiological conditions. The intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of serum albumins turns out with a chance to be a vital tool for better understanding. The results enlighten the primary information on the binding of drugs to serum albumin protein. The experimental data showed that the Stern-Volmer quenching constant

  </sub> is inversely correlated; static quenching was confirmed to result in the fluorescence quenching. The results of UV-Visible spectra indicate that the conformational changes of BSA/HSA molecules are change significantly in the presence of antidepressant drugs. None of this method for enhancing fluorescence intensity of CDs by modifying CDs with serum albumins by virtue of the activated effect of antidepressant drugs was proposed. In this study firstly biconjugated quantum dots with serum albumins further studies the interaction of bioconjugated SA with antidepressant drugs. The drug-protein interaction based on quantum dots of biological significance is evident since albumin serves as a carrier of protein carrier for multiple drugs.
