 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dynamic light scattering (DLS) experiment was conducted with particles dispersed and size distribution during the assembly of CDs-SA-Drug. The variation in size, scattering intensities observed for antidepressant drugs and CDs. Particle size distribution was found in the range of 1–1000 nm. The results from DLS measurements showed that the size (diameter) of the nanohybrids did not change with the increasing number of serum albumins per CDs and antidepressant drugs, upon addition of various molar ratio of SA-antidepressant drugs. DLS determinations showed that the negative surface charge of the quantum dots neutralized upon adsorption of the serum albumin and drug. Generally, the ζ-potential of CDs was reduced when SA-drug were bond that the surface, further increase of the drug concentration did not lead to significant changes in the DLS as shown in 
  <a rid="fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#fig6">Fig. 6</a>. Moreover, the data revealed that the nanohybrid is a complex between CDs and protein which were formed due to electrostatic interactions of the negatively charged CDs and the cationic “hot spot” around the active site of SA antidepressant drugs. It also revealed the exact amount of SA-antidepressant drugs adsorbed over each CDs.
