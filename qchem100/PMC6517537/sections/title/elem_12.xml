  <p id="p0070" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence spectroscopy has been mostly used in the investigation of molecular interactions between ligands and proteins. The variety of parameters related to binding mechanism of antidepressant drugs with serum albumins have been investigated by means of fluorescence measurements. Serum albumins have three intrinsic fluorophores residues tryptophan (Trp), tyrosine (Tyr) and phenylalanine (Phen) 
   <a rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib43">[43]</a>. Generally, the Trp alone contribute to intrinsic fluorescence, because Phen has a very low quantum yield and the fluorescence of Tyr get completely quenched when ionized. Therefore, the fluorescence of BSA and HSA regularly decreases with increasing concentration of drugs but does not show any significant shift of the emission at maximum wavelength. The fluorescence spectra of BSA and HSA with varying concentration of antidepressant drugs are shown in

  <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the presence of CDs, there are two types binding sites with various affinities that depend on the size of quantum dots. It is revealed that the interaction between SA and drugs in the presence of carbon dots have different behaviors; therefore CDs have various applications in protein solution that can be related to their different hydration layers. 
   <span class="italic">K</span>
   <sub>a</sub> is a measure of the binding of the proteins to the drugs, suggesting that the 
   <span class="italic">K</span>
   <sub>a</sub> value for SA-drug increasing in the presence of CDs at λ
   <sub>ex</sub> = 278 nm. These results led to the conclusion that the interaction between drug and SA changed after addition of CDs to the SA-drug complex. Consequently, the CDs caused a stronger complex to be established. The interaction behavior of SA-drug changed with the presence of CDs in the ternary systems at λex = 280 nm was higher than at λex = 295 nm, because at λex = 280 nm both Tyr and Trp were excited, whereas at λex = 295 nm only Trp was excited.
