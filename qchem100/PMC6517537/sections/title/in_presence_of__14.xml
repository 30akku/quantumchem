 <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the presence of CDs, there are two types binding sites with various affinities that depend on the size of quantum dots. It is revealed that the interaction between SA and drugs in the presence of carbon dots have different behaviors; therefore CDs have various applications in protein solution that can be related to their different hydration layers. 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>a</sub> is a measure of the binding of the proteins to the drugs, suggesting that the 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>a</sub> value for SA-drug increasing in the presence of CDs at λ
  <sub>ex</sub> = 278 nm. These results led to the conclusion that the interaction between drug and SA changed after addition of CDs to the SA-drug complex. Consequently, the CDs caused a stronger complex to be established. The interaction behavior of SA-drug changed with the presence of CDs in the ternary systems at λex = 280 nm was higher than at λex = 295 nm, because at λex = 280 nm both Tyr and Trp were excited, whereas at λex = 295 nm only Trp was excited. The values of 
  <span class="italic">K</span>
  <sub>a</sub> and n are listed in Tables 
  <a rid="tbl1" ref-type="table" href="#tbl1">1</a> and 
  <a rid="tbl2" ref-type="table" href="#tbl2">2</a>. As can be seen, the interaction between SA and drug in the absence and presence of CDs respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, so many works reported in related to drug-protein interaction, but drug –protein interaction in presence of nanoparticles a least research articles published.
