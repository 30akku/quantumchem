 <p id="p0055" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using diffuse reflectance method FT-IR spectra were taken on a Nicolet iS10 Fourier transform infrared spectroscope (Thermofisher) by KBr pellets as a background. The FT-IR spectra of HSA and BSA in the presence and absence of drug at 27 °C were recorded in the range of 1500–1700 cm
