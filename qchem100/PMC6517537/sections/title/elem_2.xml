  <p id="p0035" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Human serum albumin (HSA) and bovine serum albumin (BSA) (purity 99.96%) and antidepressant drugs amitryptiline hydrochloride (AMT), desipramine hydrochloride (DSP) and chlorpromazine hydrochloride (CPZ) (purity 99.88%) were procured from Sigma Aldrich Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore. Glucose and polyethyleneglycol-200 (PEG-200) procured from Sigma Aldrich Pvt. Ltd. Bangalore. All chemicals were employed as purchased and their standard solutions were prepared using Millipore water. All serum albumin solutions were prepared by phosphate buffer solution.</p>

   <p id="p0040" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The CDs was synthesized by one-pot method 
    <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">[41]</a>. In a beaker 1.0 g glucose and 15 ml PEG-200 was added, and dissolve it in 30 ml Millipore water followed by stirring for 10 minutes, till a clear solution was obtained. Now the solution was heated in a hot air oven for 1 hr at 160 °C. A pale yellow color solution was obtained. This solution was kept for dialysis by dialysis membrane 500 cutoffs for one day and again dialysis by dialysis membrane 1000 cutoffs. The resulted CDs stored at 4 °C.

The excitation wavelength kept for BSA and HSA fluorescence was 280nm and its emission spectra were scanned in the range of 290–450 nm. Both excitation and emission slit widths were fixed at 5 nm. The fluorescence quenching measurements have been also performed for determining the binding constant (

The absorption spectra were scanned in the range of 240–450 nm. The absorbance measurements were performed keeping the concentration of serum albumins and varying the concentration of drugs from 0 to 0.55 mM and different concentration of CDs.</p>

   <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the formulated quantum dots were determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis using ZetaSizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Limited, Japan) equipped with a 4.0 mW He-Ne laser operating at 630 nm. For the particle size measurements 1 ml sample of quantum dots dispersion were taken in disposable cuvettes. All measurements were carried out after dispersing the quantum dots in appropriate volume of water at 300 K, at detection angle 120 °C for zeta potential.</p>
