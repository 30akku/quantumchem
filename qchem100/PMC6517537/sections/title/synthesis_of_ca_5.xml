  <a rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr" href="#bib41">[41]</a>. In a beaker 1.0 g glucose and 15 ml PEG-200 was added, and dissolve it in 30 ml Millipore water followed by stirring for 10 minutes, till a clear solution was obtained. Now the solution was heated in a hot air oven for 1 hr at 160 °C. A pale yellow color solution was obtained. This solution was kept for dialysis by dialysis membrane 500 cutoffs for one day and again dialysis by dialysis membrane 1000 cutoffs. The resulted CDs stored at 4 °C.
