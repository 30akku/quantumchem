 <p id="p0060" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The average hydrodynamic diameter and zeta potential of the formulated quantum dots were determined by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis using ZetaSizer Nano ZS90 (Malvern Instruments Limited, Japan) equipped with a 4.0 mW He-Ne laser operating at 630 nm. For the particle size measurements 1 ml sample of quantum dots dispersion were taken in disposable cuvettes. All measurements were carried out after dispersing the quantum dots in appropriate volume of water at 300 K, at detection angle 120 Â°C for zeta potential.</p>
