 <p id="p0045" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fluorescence quenching mechanisms were investigated on a Cary Eclipse Fluorescence Spectrophotometer using a quartz cell with 1.0 cm path length in a thermostatically controlled cell holder at 300K. The excitation wavelength kept for BSA and HSA fluorescence was 280nm and its emission spectra were scanned in the range of 290â€“450 nm. Both excitation and emission slit widths were fixed at 5 nm. The fluorescence quenching measurements have been also performed for determining the binding constant (
