 <p id="p0050" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The absorption measurements of solutions were carried out by Carry-50 UV-Vis spectrophotometer using a matched pair of quartz cells (path length: 1 cm) at 27 °C. The absorption spectra were scanned in the range of 240–450 nm. The absorbance measurements were performed keeping the concentration of serum albumins and varying the concentration of drugs from 0 to 0.55 mM and different concentration of CDs.</p>
