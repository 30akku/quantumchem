 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) The strongly confined ∣

  </span>∣ fields in a single isolated QD (CdSe/ZnS) with a 0.5-nm dielectric capping layer (Al
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub>) and a tilted Au tip induce coupling between the plasmon and exciton. Simulated out-of-plane (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) and in-plane (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) optical field distributions in the plasmonic cavity shown in (A). a.u., arbitrary units. (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) Energy diagram for the plasmonic cavity (red), QD (blue), and upper and lower polariton states (green) with PL energy in the weak (orange) and strong (green) coupling regimes. When the coupling exceeds system losses, the split polariton states emerge and the system begins to undergo Rabi splittings and Rabi oscillations, as illustrated above.
