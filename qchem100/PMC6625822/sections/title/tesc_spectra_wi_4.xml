 <div class="title">TESC spectra with increasing coupling strength and plexciton energy diagram with QD detuning.</div>
 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) TEPL spectra of different single QDs with variation in coupling strength 
  <span class="italic">g</span> and Rabi frequency. (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) Polariton energies from model fits (circles) and anticrossing curves from model calculations (lines) for each of the measured TEPL spectra of 21 different QDs. The expected surface plasmon (red) and QD (blue) detuning dependence is obtained from averaged values from the modeled 21 spectra.
