  </a>) at the single-photon level. Our demonstration of TESC of single QD plexciton PL opens a new paradigm of perturbative near-field microscopy in the quantum limit that can be generalized to any optical modality. Specifically, the ability to rapidly and reversibly change the coupling strength through nanoscale tip positioning provides a new means of tuning these quantum-optical interfaces, providing a degree of functionality to control quantum dynamics. TESC can be extended further by using emitters with larger TDM, tips that provide smaller mode volume, and nanoplasmonic tip engineering to optimize the plasmon resonance. It is not limited to plexciton control and can be applied to a variety of quantum states ranging from exciton-polariton Bose-Einstein condensates (
