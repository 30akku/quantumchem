 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs (900249-1ML; Sigma-Aldrich) were stabilized with octadecylamine ligands in toluene. The QDs were drop-casted on an Au film coated with Al
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> and blown off by air after 10 to 20 s to avoid aggregation. From AFM imaging, we verified that the density of the QDs on the surface was ∼5 dots in a 1 μm by 1 μm window and that they were well dispersed. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit the base and capping layers of Al
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water as precursors. Depositions were performed in a custom-built flow tube reactor. The base layers were deposited at 200°C, while the capping layers were deposited at 80°C to avoid thermal degradation of the QDs. Depositions occurred under a steady flow of N
  <sub>2</sub>. Each ALD cycle consisted of 0.1 s of TMA pulse, 30 s of N
  <sub>2</sub> purge, 0.5 s of water pulse, and 30 s of N
  <sub>2</sub> purge. The growth rates of Al
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub> were ∼0.1 nm per cycle at 200°C and ∼0.08 nm per cycle at 80°C. The number of ALD cycles was adjusted accordingly to achieve the desired dielectric film thickness. The film thickness was confirmed via spectroscopic ellipsometry (alpha-SE, J.A. Woollam) measurements on companion Si wafers.
