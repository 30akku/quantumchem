  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Commercially available CdSe/ZnS QDs (900249-1ML; Sigma-Aldrich) were stabilized with octadecylamine ligands in toluene. The QDs were drop-casted on an Au film coated with Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> and blown off by air after 10 to 20 s to avoid aggregation. From AFM imaging, we verified that the density of the QDs on the surface was ∼5 dots in a 1 μm by 1 μm window and that they were well dispersed. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) was used to deposit the base and capping layers of Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and water as precursors. Depositions were performed in a custom-built flow tube reactor. The base layers were deposited at 200°C, while the capping layers were deposited at 80°C to avoid thermal degradation of the QDs. Depositions occurred under a steady flow of N
   <sub>2</sub>. Each ALD cycle consisted of 0.1 s of TMA pulse, 30 s of N
   <sub>2</sub> purge, 0.5 s of water pulse, and 30 s of N
   <sub>2</sub> purge. The growth rates of Al
   <sub>2</sub>O
   <sub>3</sub> were ∼0.1 nm per cycle at 200°C and ∼0.08 nm per cycle at 80°C. The number of ALD cycles was adjusted accordingly to achieve the desired dielectric film thickness. The film thickness was confirmed via spectroscopic ellipsometry (alpha-SE, J.A. Woollam) measurements on companion Si wafers.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">TESC spectroscopy setup</div>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the TESC spectroscopy setup, the sample was mounted to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT, P-611.3, Physik Instrumente) with subnanometer precision positioning below an electrically driven and controlled quartz tuning fork (resonance frequency, 32 kHz), which was used to regulate the tip-sample distance using AFM shear-force amplitude feedback (

    <span class="italic">57</span>
   </a>). Electrochemically etched Au tips (~5- to 10-nm apex radius) were attached to the tuning fork and coarsely positioned using a stepper motor (MX25, Mechonics AG), and shear-force feedback and sample positioning were controlled with a digital AFM controller (R9, RHK Technology). In the TESC spectroscopy setup, the sample was mounted at a 35° angle to the tip axis to maximize the electric field confinement (

    <span class="italic">29</span>
   </a>). Excitation was provided by a helium-neon laser beam (632.8 nm, ≤1 mW) with a half-wave plate for polarization control that was focused onto the tip-sample interface using an objective lens (numerical aperture, 0.8; LMPLFLN100×; Olympus). PL signal was collected in a backscattering geometry, passed through a dichroic mirror with a 633-nm cutoff, and sent to a spectrometer (
   <span class="italic">f</span> = 500 mm, SpectraPro 500i, Princeton Instruments) with a thermoelectrically cooled, electron-multiplied, charge-coupled device (ProEM+: 1600 eXcelon3, Princeton Instruments). The spectrometer was calibrated using a hydrogen mercury lamp, and a 150 g/mm grating blazed for 800 nm was used to provide high-bandwidth spectral information.
