 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the TESC spectroscopy setup, the sample was mounted to a piezoelectric transducer (PZT, P-611.3, Physik Instrumente) with subnanometer precision positioning below an electrically driven and controlled quartz tuning fork (resonance frequency, 32 kHz), which was used to regulate the tip-sample distance using AFM shear-force amplitude feedback (

  </a>). Electrochemically etched Au tips (~5- to 10-nm apex radius) were attached to the tuning fork and coarsely positioned using a stepper motor (MX25, Mechonics AG), and shear-force feedback and sample positioning were controlled with a digital AFM controller (R9, RHK Technology). In the TESC spectroscopy setup, the sample was mounted at a 35° angle to the tip axis to maximize the electric field confinement (

  </a>). Excitation was provided by a helium-neon laser beam (632.8 nm, ≤1 mW) with a half-wave plate for polarization control that was focused onto the tip-sample interface using an objective lens (numerical aperture, 0.8; LMPLFLN100×; Olympus). PL signal was collected in a backscattering geometry, passed through a dichroic mirror with a 633-nm cutoff, and sent to a spectrometer (

The spectrometer was calibrated using a hydrogen mercury lamp, and a 150 g/mm grating blazed for 800 nm was used to provide high-bandwidth spectral information.
