  <p>The network of redox reactions obtained from iterative reductions and oxidations of natural metabolites. (A) Carbon number distribution for the full set of ∼70 000 compounds in the network. The peaks at multiples of 6 carbon atoms reflect the combinatorial oxidation of mono-, di-, and trisaccharides and their multiple alcohol functional groups. (B) Schematic diagram of a natural trisaccharide being iteratively oxidized at all possible alcohol functional groups. Blue circles depict sites of initial alcohol-to-carbonyl oxidation, and green circles depict a second oxidation site.</p>
