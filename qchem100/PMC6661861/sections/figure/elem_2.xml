  <p>Comparison of prediction accuracy for the group contribution method and quantum chemistry with GP regression. Scatter plots of experimental standard transformed redox potentials against predictions from several sources: (a) PM7, (b) linearly calibrated PM7, (c) group contribution method (GCM), and (d) GP-calibrated PM7. The experimental data consist of available standard transformed reduction potentials for carbonyl-to-alcohol and carbonyl-to-amine reductions. Data points in the scatter plot were obtained from a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) procedure, where the model is trained on all data points except the one point to be predicted. Note that we use the millimolar standard state,

The legend in each plot contains summary statistics for the fit; MAE (mean absolute error) also has the associated standard deviation in parentheses.
