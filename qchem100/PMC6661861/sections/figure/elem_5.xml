  <p>Elucidating structureâ€“energy relationships using a reaction fingerprint heatmap. The top right panel shows the distribution of predicted standard redox potentials (in the millimolar standard state) using our GP-calibrated quantum chemical approach. The bottom right panel shows a reaction fingerprint heatmap, where the 
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis corresponds to the bits in the reaction fingerprint vector averaged across all reactions falling within a redox potential bin (range of values). The heatmap highlights bits that have significantly different values (on average) as a function of redox potential. The example reactions on the left correspond to each of the significant reaction fingerprint bits. For example, Bit-4 is a structure enriched in substrate molecules of reactions with high values of standard redox potentials.
