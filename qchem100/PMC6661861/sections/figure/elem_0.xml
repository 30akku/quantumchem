  <p>Schematic representation of the workflow. (A) We generate a network of redox reactions obtained from iterative reduction and oxidation of natural seed metabolites. The redox reactions considered are reductions of carbonyl functional groups to both alcohol and amine groups. (B) Starting from simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES)
