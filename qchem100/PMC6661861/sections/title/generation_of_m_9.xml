 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our pipeline is based on performing electronic structure simulations of the most protonated species of each biochemical compound involved in every redox reaction of interest. We run the quantum chemistry simulations on the major protonation states at pH = 0 to avoid errors associated with the prediction of anionic compound energies.
