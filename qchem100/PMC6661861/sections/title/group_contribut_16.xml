  </span> Briefly, group energies of all compounds in the KEGG database are stored in a group matrix, with rows corresponding to compounds and columns corresponding to groups. Associated to each group is a group energy corresponding to the energy for the group’s major protonation state (major species) at pH = 7. To obtain a GCM-based estimate for a standard transformed reduction potential for the major species at pH = 7, we take the difference in group energy vectors for all products and substrate in the reaction. We then transform the resulting standard redox potentials
