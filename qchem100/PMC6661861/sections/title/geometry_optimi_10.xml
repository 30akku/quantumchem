  </span> for each compound in the reaction network, we obtain the string corresponding to the most abundant (major) microspecies at pH = 0 using ChemAxon. This smiles string is then converted to an RDKit “mol” object. From here we obtain 3D structures based on two decisions. (1) Whenever we want a single 3D geometry, we generate an initial conformer with RDKit (using the EmbedMolecule command, which uses distance geometry to obtain initial coordinates for a molecule), and we optimize this conformer’s geometry Universal Force Field (UFF) as implemented in RDKit.
