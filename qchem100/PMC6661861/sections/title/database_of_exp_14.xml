 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To ensure we are not overfitting in the process of calibrating with GP regression, we used leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV), where we train our model on all data points except one point and predict its value. This is done for all 81 data points, and reported predictions, accuracies, and resulting scatter plots always come from untrained data. It is also important to note that GPs are inherently robust to overfitting since the training procedure penalizes more complex models (higher-rank kernels) via an objective function.
