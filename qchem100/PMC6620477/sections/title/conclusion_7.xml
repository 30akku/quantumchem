  <sub>2</sub> nanoparticles loaded with N doping carbon quantum dots-N-CDs/P25 composites-were synthesis using hydrothermal method to extend their photoresponse range and improve photocatalytic stability. Our results showed that the precipitation of N-CDs on P25 could considerably enhance the visible-light photocatalytic activity of P25. The screened best catalyst is (6 mL)N-CDs/TNS, its degradation rate constant was found to be 13.06 folds of pure P25. TEM confirmed the as prepared N-CDs/P25 composites structure; the N-CDs are spherical and highly dispersed with a mean size of approximately 3 nm. UV-vis DRS spectra verified the efficient absorption edge extension from UV to visible light region. XPS measurements proved that the N-CDs have been chemically bonded to P25 by C-O-Ti. The high photocatalytic can be attributed to the synergistic effects of the Z-scheme structure, the biphasic heterojunction of P25, the extension of visible light absorption edge, and the prolonged e
