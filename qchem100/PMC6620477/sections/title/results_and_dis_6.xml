  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. Firstly citric acid was carbonized with hydrothermal process to form N-doped CDs and was purified through centrifugation and dialysis. Then mixed the N-CDs solution and P25 with hydrothermal reaction, Ti-OH on the surface of P25 dehydrates easily with the C-OH groups on the N-CDs surfaces, chemically formation of the N-CDs/P25 composites.

  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> shows that no N-CDs peak was detected; this may be attributed to the situation that the C quantum dots is greatly scattered on P25 nanoparticles. In addition the low doping content of C quantum dots is another factor that caused the disappearance of N-CDs signals in the XRD measurement.

  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b–d</a>, respectively. The C 1 s XPS spectrum shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a> was deconvoluted fitted as four peaks: The binding energy observed at 285.88 eV was attributed to C–O group, binding energy at 288.78 eV was assigned as the C=O carbonyl group, energy at 285.18 eV ascribed to C-N, the peak at 284.58 eV comes from the C–H/C=C/C–C group. The above deconvoluted fitted spectra indicate that N-CDs and N-CDs/P25 composites are rich of O element and N element. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a> shows that the intensity of O signal in the C XPS spectrum decreased for N-CDs/P25 relative to N-CDs, which means that P25 have been covered by N-CDs. The XPS pattern of O 1 s shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> indicates the great difference between N-CDs and N-CDs/P25. N-CDs in top panel of Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a> shows, the binding energy at 533.59 eV ascribed to the C-O and -OH, deconvoluted peak at 532.07 eV were related to carbonyl group, after integration with P25, as bottom panel shows, these peaks were shifted towards lower order values. 529.68 eV for Ti-O, 530.08 eV for carbonyl group, 532.08 eV for C-O and -OH, respectively. The above comparisons in XPS spectra demonstrate the strong interaction between the TiO
  <sub>2</sub> and C after the solvothermal process and further confirm the successful integration of N-CDs on P25. The N 1 s peaks detected at 400.08 and 401.78 eV in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a> demonstrate that N element presents primary in N-H (401.78 eV) or N-C(400.08 eV) style, respectively, either on the N-CDs or N-CDs/P25. Specifically there is no C−Ti peak detected, which means N-CDs integrated to P25 were not directly trough C–Ti bond, but takes the form of Ti-O-C.

They all show strong absorption in the UV region, while only the N-CDs/P25 have medium absorption band across the whole visible light region, among which (6 mL) N-CDs/P25 has the highest visible light absorption intensity. Obviously the absorption edge for N-CDs/P25 shows a red shift relative to P25. This phenomenon of visible region absorption band and absorption edge red shift can be explained by the fact of N-doping CDs deposition on the catalysts, decreased the light reflection.

The broad fluorescence spectra range from 350 nm to 550 nm. In addition, the emission spectra show typical excitation laser wavelength dependent property, which suggests its complicate energy band composition, either in ground state or excited band. The XPS detected carbonyl and C-N groups in N-CDs will influence the energy band structures of C-dots sp

The probability of each transition is depends on the excitation wavelength. The excited electrons come back to their own ground state with radiative transition, producing multiple fluorescence emissions. The weights of excited resonant electrons satisfy Gaussian distribution, centered with excitation laser wavelength. The weight of each transition is dependent on the excitation laser, correspondingly the weight of each fluorescence emissions also changes with the excitation wavelength, result in the wavelengths dependent properties. It is well known that doping of the N element in C dots can reduce the band gap. Furthermore, the chemical linking of N to C will introduce additional energy level that can trap the e

 <p id="Par17" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rhodamine B(RhB) is one kind of the important dyes that has been popular applied in industrial application, which forms the pollutions to environments. In this article the degradation of RhB was chosen as the model reaction. The photocatalytic performance was compared among N-CDs
  <span class="bold">/</span>P25 photocatalysts, N-CDs and P25. Figure 
  <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the concentration changes of RhB with degradation time. No RhB self degradation was observed under visible light irradiation(400~780 nm). In addition there is no obvious RhB degradation either under visible light irradiation over N-CD catalysts. Approximately 30% concentration decrease was observed over P25 within 90 minutes. In contrast, the N-CDs/P25 catalysts showed higher visible-light degradation activity. Specially the RhB were completely removed by (6 mL)N-CDs/P25 within 90 minutes. It is interestingly to stress that the RhB removal activity increases with the series of N-CDs from 2 mL to 6 mL. However, further increasing the loading content will decrease the catalytic performance. The linear fitting of ln(C/C
  <sub>0</sub>) versus time (see in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8a</a>) based on the simplified Langmuir-Hinshelwood model suggests that the RhB removal dynamics obeys a first order kinetic. The apparent rate constant (k) obtained from the linear fitting were shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig8" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig8">8b</a>. The highest k is obtained from (6 mL)N-CDs/TNS catalyst, approximately k = 5.029 × 10

  <span class="sup">−1</span>, which is 13.06 folds photocatalytic activity improvement over P25 (k = 0.00385 min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). The obtained apparent rates constants suggest that there is a optimal N-CDs loading content on P25 for optimize the photocatalytic performance. The integration of N-CDs on P25 gives the photocatalysts several prominent features: improved catalysts adaptability, increased adsorption ability of pollutants, extension of light absorption edge to visible region and prolonged lifetime of photo generated electron-hole pair.

  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11a</a> we can get the reduction potential value is −0.61 V. with the equation E
  <sub>LUMO</sub> = −e (E

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>. Based on the UV–VIS DRS spectra shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5</a> and LUMO energy, the HOMO energy can be known E
  <sub>HOMO</sub> = −6.81 V. Z-scheme can be drawn based on the energy data, according to the further active trapping results (Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig11" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig11">11b</a>). The visible light induced dynamic pathway of electron can be described using Z-scheme heterojunction structures as following: the N-CDs electron in HOMO was excited to LUMO by visible light irradiation. Meanwhile, P25 can absorber the 400 nm light and the electrons are excited to the CB state due to the weak absorption “tail”. Moreover the RhB dye self-sensitization on surface of photocatalysts also lowered the band gap of p25 and favors the visible light absorption. In sum, the ground electrons on both sides could be excited by visible light to produce e
  <span class="sup">−</span>h
  <span class="sup">+</span> separation couple. Then the produced e
  <span class="sup">−</span> in LUMO orbital can annihilate the h
  <span class="sup">+</span> in VB of P25, the e
  <span class="sup">−</span> in CB of P25 and the h
  <span class="sup">+</span> carriers in HOMO of CDs were spatially separated. This process favors the e
  <span class="sup">−</span> accumulation on P25 rather radiative transition to VB. Because no h
  <span class="sup">+</span> are remaining on P25, much longer lifetimes of the hot electrons on the CB could be expected, thus increase the probability to reduce the O
  <sub>2</sub> adsorbed on the P25 and helps the photo degradation of RhB. In the meantime, the h
  <span class="sup">+</span> carriers of N-CDs HOMO orbital may attack directly the dye pollutions, or react with H
  <sub>2</sub>O to form

  <a rid="Fig12" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig12">12</a>. The degradation efficiency of RhB exhibits high stability after 5 successive continuously recycles of the catalysts under identical conditions. Intrinsic biphasic structure of P25, the application of most affinity force size of the N-CDs and the strong interaction between the P25 and N-CDs heterojunction may account for this superior catalytic stability.
