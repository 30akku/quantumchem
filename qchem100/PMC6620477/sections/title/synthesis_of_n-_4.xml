 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">N-CDs/P25 was synthesized via a hydrothermal deposition process. Typically, 0.2 g P25 was put into certain volume of as-prepared N-CDs solution and added 40 mL more water, mixed and transferred to a dried Teflon-lined hydrothermal reaction vessel, heated to 200 °C and kept for 6 hours. After cooling down the mixture were then centrifuged at 8000r/min to collect the final product. The samples were named according to the added volume of N-CDs as (2 mL)N-CDs/P25, (4 mL)N-CDs/P25, (6 mL)N-CDs/P25, (8 mL)N-CDs/P25 and (10 mL)N-CDs/P25</p>
