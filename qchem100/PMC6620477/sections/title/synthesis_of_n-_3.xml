  </span>. Typically 4 mmol citric acid and 12 mmol urea were dissolved together in 20 ml distilled water, and then poured into a 100 ml Teflon lined hydrothermal reaction vessel. The reaction take place at 200 °C and kept for 8 hours. Then Cool to ambient temperature and adjusting the pH to 7. Centrifuge to get a dark yellowish N-CDs solution. The solution was put in a dialysis tube (keep molecular weight: 500 Da~3500 Da) for 4 days in the dark (changed deionized water every 8 h). Concentration to 20 mL.
