 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) were chosen as model reaction to evaluation the photocatalytic activities of the as synthesized material under visible light irradiation. Xenon lamp with a &lt;400 nm cutoff filter was used as the photo source to mimic the nature solar irradiation. Generally, a 150 mL quartz reactor were equipped with a thermostat to keep the degradation temperature at 28 °C, in which put 10 mg/L RhB100 mL. Into the RhB solution added 50 mg catalysts. Keep the mixture in the dark for 30 min to make sure the catalysts saturated with the adsorption of RhB. Turn on the lamp to start the photocatalytic reaction and accumulate the irradiation time. To trace the dynamic concentration changes of the RhB 3 mL of the mixture each time was taken out from the reactant at regular intervals. The concentration was obtained by UV-VIS measurements.</p>
