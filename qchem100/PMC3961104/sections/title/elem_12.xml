 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One aspect of carrying out quantum mechanical calculations on peptide fragments is the way the peptide strands are terminated or capped. This can be important, since the properties calculated from a quantum mechanical calculation may be affected by how the protein is truncated to a model peptide. The specific type of cap is controlled by setting the keywords 
  <span class="monospace">nterm</span> and 
  <span class="monospace">cterm</span> keywords (for the N-terminus and C-terminus, respectively) when the peptide object is created.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By default, FragBuilder generates methyl caps by adding a CH
  <sub>3</sub>–C(=O)- group to the N-terminus and an -NH–CH
  <sub>3</sub> group to the C-terminus (i.e., if the keywords are not set). This corresponds to setting both keywords (
  <span class="monospace">nterm</span> and 
  <span class="monospace">cterm</span>) to 
  <span class="monospace">"methyl"</span>. Additionally, it is possible to cap the ends of the peptide as normal N- and C-termini (amine or carboxyl groups, respectively) which can be set to either a charged or a neutral state. A charged or neutral terminus is specified by passing the values 
  <span class="monospace">"charged"</span> or 
  <span class="monospace">"neutral"</span>, respectively. See 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig-4" href="#fig-4">Fig. 4</a> for a schematic of the three possible types of caps.
