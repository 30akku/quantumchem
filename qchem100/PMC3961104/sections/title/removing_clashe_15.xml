 <div class="title">Removing clashes by regularization in a tryptophan–apartate–glycine peptide.</div>
 <p>In (A) the peptide clashes between the amide proton on the C-terminal methyl cap and the amide oxygen in residue 1. In (B) this clash has been removed by constrained relaxation during the regularization procedure. Both structures have identical
