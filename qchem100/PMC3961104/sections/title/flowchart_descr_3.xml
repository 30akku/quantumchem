 <div class="title">Flowchart describing the use of FragBuilder.</div>
 <p>Simple chart of a common workflow using FragBuilder. First a peptide is generated from the sequence. Then torsion angles are set â€” either specified manually or sampled through BASILISK and a quick geometry optimization is performed using the MMFF94 force field. Finally, the structure is written to a file.</p>
