  <p>Orbital visualisation. Standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods yield delocalised orbitals that extend over the entire molecule. Localised orbitals can be found as linear combinations of the occupied delocalised orbitals by a unitary transformation. In Molden the Foster-Boys [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] scheme is employed to localize molecular orbitals. The 
   <span class="italic">left-hand panel</span> shows the localised orbital of Iron(III) meso tartaric acid. This calculation proves that there is a bond between the irons and the coordinated water molecules (ultimate 
   <span class="italic">left</span> and 
   <span class="italic">right</span> in the figure). The absence of nodal planes between iron (
   <span class="italic">yellow</span>) and water(s) is tantamount to the presence of electron density (a bond) between irons and water. The right-hand panel shows an example of the ELF on 2,5 Dimethoxyfuran with evidence of lone pairs and covalent bonds.
