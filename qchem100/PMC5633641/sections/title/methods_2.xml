 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Molden code consists of 100,000 lines Fortran and 60,000 lines C. The C code allows for the efficient communication with graphics application programming layers (API’s). Molden makes use of two such API’s: The X Window System protocol client library [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15" href="#CR15">15</a>] and the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16" href="#CR16">16</a>] that is a multi-platform API for rendering 2D and 3D vector graphics. In addition, Molden uses the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17" href="#CR17">17</a>] to program shaders, small programs that run on the graphics hardware to produce special effects such as per-pixel lighting, blurring, shadows, and ambient occlusion. The native Microsoft Windows version of Molden uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL2.0) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18" href="#CR18">18</a>] to replace the X window library.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molden’s ‘read file’ window, allows for the direct download (using the external network download program ‘wget’) of files from the PDB (
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://www.rcsb.org/</span>) by specifying the unique four-letter PDB-identifier. The same ‘wget’ can also be used to retrieve information about missing hydrogens from the EBI’s PDBECHEM database [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19" href="#CR19">19</a>].
