The Molden format (see

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molcas [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>] is a popular ab initio computational chemistry program that focusses on the calculation of electronic structures in ground and excited states. The Molcas authors recommend that their users apply Molden for visualization. The widely used and often cited Gabedit software [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>] (freeware) is a graphical user interface, offering pre-processing and post-processing options for nine computational chemistry software packages. The Molden format has a prominent position in their list of supported formats. So they use Molden to widen their application base.

     <p>Orbital visualisation. Standard ab initio quantum chemistry methods yield delocalised orbitals that extend over the entire molecule. Localised orbitals can be found as linear combinations of the occupied delocalised orbitals by a unitary transformation. In Molden the Foster-Boys [
      <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>] scheme is employed to localize molecular orbitals. The 
      <span class="italic">left-hand panel</span> shows the localised orbital of Iron(III) meso tartaric acid. This calculation proves that there is a bond between the irons and the coordinated water molecules (ultimate 
      <span class="italic">left</span> and 
      <span class="italic">right</span> in the figure). The absence of nodal planes between iron (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Masunov et al. [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29" href="#CR29">29</a>], for example, introduced a new method to eliminate the spin-contamination in broken symmetry density functional theory calculations. They investigated two complexes of which one had strongly localized magnetic orbitals on which previous spin-contamination eliminate schemes worked well. The other complex had strongly delocalised magnetic orbitals on which previous schemes failed while their new scheme works well. Both restricted and unrestricted natural orbitals were visualized with the help of Molden.

Atzori et al. wrote: “The isodensity surface mapped with the electrostatic potential shows for all systems that the oxygen atoms are the source of greater negative charge accumulation followed by the nitrogen atom of the CN moiety. Moreover, there is a moderate negative charge accumulation on the carbon atoms linked to the Cl and CN groups, whereas the remaining four carbon atoms, which are linked to the oxygen atoms, exhibit a positive charge. The chlorine atoms present a typical positive charge on the opposite side of the C–Cl vector and a ring of negative charge perpendicular to the same vector” [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Electron Localisation Function (ELF) [
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] is a measure for the probability of finding an electron with the same spin in the neighbourhood of a reference electron at a given location (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The ELF shows clear separation between core and valence electrons, and also shows covalent bonds and lone pairs. Whereas the electron density decreases monotonically with the distance from the nucleus, the ELF illustrates the shell electronic structure (S, P, and D shells) of the heavy atoms as clear maxima and minima.
