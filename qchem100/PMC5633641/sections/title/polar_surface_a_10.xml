 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The polar surface area (PSA) is defined as the combined surface area belonging to oxygen and nitrogen atoms and their hydrogen atoms. Palm et al. [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>] were the first to use a calculated PSA to predict the absorption of drugs. A new method was designed to derive the PSA by quantum chemical means QMPSA [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>]. This is illustrated in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>. The original method by Palm et al., and our QMPSA have both been implemented in Molden.

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40" href="#CR40">40</a>], for example, analysed anticancer fungal polysaccharides based on physiochemical properties and identified a unique region in chemical space using a series of molecular descriptors including Molden’s QMPSA.
