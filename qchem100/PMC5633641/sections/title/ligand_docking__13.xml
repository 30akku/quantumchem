 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molden facilitates both interactive docking and fully automatic optimisation of ligand protein complexes. For interactive docking a Potential of Mean Force (PMF) scoring function by Muegge and Martin [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>] is being used, while the automatic optimisation of ligand protein complexes uses the AMBER force field [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>]. The PMF is derived from the radial distribution of distances between atoms of two distinct types from the PDB database (the available atom types are listed in the Molden documentation). Muegge and Rarey have reviewed the PMF scoring function in comparison to other scoring functions [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46" href="#CR46">46</a>] and reported that the PMF score outperformed the energy score and the empirical score of FlexX and is less sensitive to small coordinate changes than the FlexX score. The PMF score was the only scoring function for which a statistically significant correlation could be found between the predicted score and the measured binding affinities of inhibitor-ligand complexes. A comparison for a variety of sets of protein–ligand complexes from the PDB showed the superiority of PMF scoring over SMoG and Böhm’s score.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The PMF distributions are converted to the interatomic energy function [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47" href="#CR47">47</a>]. The PMF score is used by Molden as a measure of the likelihood of a particular ligand–protein conformation. Conformations can be generated interactively by rotation and translation of the ligand with respect to either the protein, or the world-view. Scores are displayed in a dedicated window that is continuously updated. Individual high/low scoring atom pairs can be highlighted. Figure
