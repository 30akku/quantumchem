 <p>Over the years, many users have contributed to Molden by making code adaptations, by giving feedback on new facilities, by discussing in silico chemistry, and by keeping the main Molden author sane. Special thanks go to the co-author of the first Molden paper Jan Noordik, and colleagues Martin Ott and Hens Borkent for valuable input and inspiration for new functionalities.</p>
