 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fifteen years after the release of Molden 1.0 the program is still being used by thousands of researchers around the world. In these 15 years the original set of options has been maintained and extended. The scope of Molden has also been broadened by adding many drug-design related facilities. We have described a series of improved or novel facilities. The list of novel facilities, though, is much longer than we have space for in this article. Examples are: protein structure alignment and superposition, creation of movies, support for Mopac .aux, and VASP POSCAR files, interactive generation of crystals from single molecules, reading .sdf files, making snapshots and movies, interfaces to the universal file converter openbabel [

  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>]. We hope that Molden 2.0 will contribute as much to the world of small molecule science as did Molden 1.0. The release of Molden 3.0 is planned less than 15 years from now. Molden 3.0 will broaden its scope further by expanding in the direction of drug design, incorporating functionalities such as conformational analysis and docking of small molecules. Interfacing Molden with more key softwares in the QM–MM field has started. The Ambfor crystal optimiser module will be improved by use of Ewald summation of long range interactions.
