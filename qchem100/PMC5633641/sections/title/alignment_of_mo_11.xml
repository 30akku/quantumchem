 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alignment of molecules -also known as structure superposition- has been implemented following two separate strategies, one for small molecule alignment and one for the alignment of proteins. The alignment of small molecules is illustrated in Fig.Â

    <p>Alignment of small molecules. Three equivalent atoms are selected for each molecule. The atoms labelled 1 are used to translate the first molecule on top of the second. The vectors from atom 1 to atom 2 and atom 2 to atom 3, respectively, are used for two consecutive rotations. The user can select any three atoms</p>
