 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is hard to experimentally determine the positions of hydrogens in protein structures. Consequently, hydrogen positions must be determined computationally. Optimisation of hydrogen positions includes optimisation of the hydroxyl orientation of threonine, serine, and tyrosine residues using the AMBER force field for scoring. The latter is also used for determining the necessity of histidine, glutamine, and asparagine flips, histidine protonation states and hydroxyl orientations of water in close contact with the protein.
