 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molden can also perform an AMBER based optimisation of either the whole protein–ligand complex, or of any user-selected part of it. In the latter case, the input of the user is limited to selection of the residues near the ligand as flexible or rigid, using a pop-up window dedicated to this task.</p>
