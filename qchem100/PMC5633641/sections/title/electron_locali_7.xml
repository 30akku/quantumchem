 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Electron Localisation Function (ELF) [
  <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>] is a measure for the probability of finding an electron with the same spin in the neighbourhood of a reference electron at a given location (see Fig.Â 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The ELF shows clear separation between core and valence electrons, and also shows covalent bonds and lone pairs. Whereas the electron density decreases monotonically with the distance from the nucleus, the ELF illustrates the shell electronic structure (S, P, and D shells) of the heavy atoms as clear maxima and minima.
