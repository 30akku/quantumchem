  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006471.s012" href="#pcbi.1006471.s012">S1 Text</a>, the prediction accuracy of the calibrated model chemistries was evaluated using the experimental data for the G3 reaction category only (to avoid overfitting). The labels refer to the quantum model chemistry used to perform a single point energy (SPE) calculation on geometry-optimized conformers. For both SPE model chemistries, geometry optimizations were performed using B3LYP functional, Orcaâ€™s predefined DefBas-2 basis set (
