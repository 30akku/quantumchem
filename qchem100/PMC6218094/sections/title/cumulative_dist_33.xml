 <div class="title">Cumulative distribution functions of runtimes for geometry optimization and single point energy (SPE) estimates using our quantum chemistry method.</div>
 <p>Distributions are over the entire set of molecular conformers used in our study. Geometry optimizations were performed out using DFT, with the B3LYP functional and Orcaâ€™s predefined DefBas-2 basis set, as well as the COSMO implicit solvent model (see SI section 2.3). The cumulative distributions of SPE runtimes are shown for the two best-performing model chemistries: the linear-scaling coupled cluster method DLPNO-CCSD(T), with the DefBas-4 Orca basis set (
