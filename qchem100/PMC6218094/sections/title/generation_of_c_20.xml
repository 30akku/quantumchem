 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To generate a database of all possible redox reactions involving natural compounds, we use a decomposition of all metabolites into functional groups as per the group contribution method [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref036" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref036">36</a>]. We find pairs of metabolites in the KEGG database with functional group vectors whose difference matches the reaction signature of any of the redox reaction categories of interest. For example, pairs of metabolites in the G1 category will have a group difference vector with a +1/-1 in the element corresponding to a carbonyl/carboxylic acid functional group respectively (see SI for details). We note that every reaction generated by this strategy can be uniquely assigned to one of the four redox categories considered.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using this method we succeeded in generating a rough database of redox reactions. However, additional manual and semi-automated data cleansing was required to get the final version of the database (see SI for further details). For example, use of the group difference vectors failed to account for the chirality of the metabolites, and in some instances stereochemistry was not maintained throughout the reaction. In order to solve this, we applied an additional filter, which used the conventions for assigning chirality (R/S, L/D) present in molecule names to match chirality between the substrate and product. Sugars proved to be especially problematic as those reactions did not maintain stereochemistry throughout; for these reactions, the above filtering method did not suffice, often keeping incorrect reactions such as L-Xylonate â†’ L-Arabinose. For this, we used molecular naming conventions to eliminate the wrong reactions (see SI for further details).</p>
