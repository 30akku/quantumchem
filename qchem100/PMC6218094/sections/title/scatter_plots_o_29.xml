 <div class="title">Scatter plots of experimental redox potentials and predicted potentials with the selected calibrated quantum chemistry approach (upper four panels) and group contribution method (GCM) (lower four panels) for all four redox categories.</div>
 <p>Quantum chemical predictions were performed using the double-hybrid DFT functional B2PLYP, the DefBas-2 Orca default basis set, the COSMO implicit solvent, and D3 dispersion correction (S1 Text). Data corresponds to experimental values and predictions at the pH = 7 and I = 0.25 biochemical state. G1: reduction of an unmodified carboxylic acid (-COO) to a carbonyl (-C = O); G2: reduction of a carbonyl to a hydroxycarbon (-COH, i.e., alcohol); G3: reduction of a carbonyl to an amine (-CNH3); and G4: reduction of a hydroxycarbon to a hydrocarbon (-C-C-).</p>
