 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to understand life we need to understand the forces that support and constrain it. Thermodynamics provides the fundamental constraints that shape metabolism [

  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref005" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref005">5</a>]. Redox reactions constitute the primary metabolic pillars that support life. Life itself can be viewed as an electron transport process that conserves and dissipates energy in order to generate and maintain a heritable local order [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref006" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref006">6</a>]. Indeed, almost 40% of all known metabolic reactions are redox reactions [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref008">8</a>]. Redox biochemistry has shaped the study of diverse fields in biology, including origin-of-life [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref009" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref009">9</a>], circadian clocks [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref010" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref010">10</a>], carbon-fixation [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref011" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref011">11</a>], cellular aging [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref012" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref012">12</a>], and host-pathogen interactions [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref013" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref013">13</a>]. Previous work has demonstrated that a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic parameters governing redox reactions reveals design principles of metabolic pathways. For example, the unfavorable nature of carboxyl reduction and carboxylation explains to a large degree the ATP investment required to support carbon fixation [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Developing a deep understanding of redox biochemistry requires a comprehensive and accurate set of reduction potential values covering a broad range of reaction types. However, only ~100 reduction potentials can be inferred from experimental data, and these suffer from inconsistencies in experimental setup and conditions. Alternatively, group contribution methods (GCM) can be used to predict a large set of Gibbs energies of formation and reduction potentials [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref014" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref014">14</a>]. However, the accuracy of this approach is limited, as GCM do not account for interactions between functional groups within a single molecule and GCM predictions are limited to metabolites with functional groups spanned by the model and experimental data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantum chemistry is an alternative modeling approach that has been used to predict redox potentials in the context of numerous applications, such as redox flow batteries, optoelectronics, and design of redox agents [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref015" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref015">15</a>–
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref027">27</a>]. Unlike GCM, whose smallest distinct unit is a functional group, quantum chemistry directly relates to the atomic and electronic configuration of a molecule, enabling ab initio prediction of molecular energetics. Here, we adopt a quantum chemistry modeling approach from the field of redox flow battery design [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref025">25</a>,
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref026">26</a>,
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref028">28</a>] to predict the reduction potentials of biochemical redox pairs. Our approach combines 
  <span class="italic">ab initio</span> quantum chemistry estimates with (minimal) calibration against available experimental data. We show that the quantum chemical method can predict experimentally derived reduction potentials with considerably higher accuracy than GCM when calibrated with only two parameters. We use this method to estimate the reduction potentials of all possible redox pairs that can be generated from the KEGG database of biochemical compounds [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref008">8</a>]. This enables us to decipher general trends between and within groups of oxidoreductase reactions, which highlight design principles encoded in cellular metabolism. We specifically focus on explaining the central role of NAD(P) as electron carrier from the perspective of the redox reactions it supports and the role it plays in lowering the concentration of reactive carbonyls.
