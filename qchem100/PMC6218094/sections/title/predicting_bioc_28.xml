 <p>(A-C) Calibrating quantum chemical estimates through linear regression (2-parameters per reaction category) significantly improves prediction accuracy. Quantum chemical predictions were performed using the double-hybrid DFT functional B2PLYP, the DefBas-2 Orca basis set, COSMO implicit solvent, and D3 dispersion correction (

Points in red correspond to reactions which consistently appear as outliers across modeling approaches: the indolepyruvate reduction to indolelactate and succinate semialdehyde reduction to 4-hydroxybutanoate (D-E) Prediction accuracy of group contribution method (10 parameters for the G2 category) and molecular fingerprints (166 parameters calibrated with regularized Lasso regression). (F) Scatter plot of normalized prediction errors (z-scores) of G2 reactions for molecular fingerprints and quantum chemistry. The indolelactate dehydrogenase (EC 1.1.1.110) and the succinate semialdehyde reductase (EC 1.1.1.61) reactions have potentially erroneous experimental values.
