 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We used the calibrated quantum chemistry model to predict redox potentials for a database of natural and non-natural redox reactions. We generated this dataset by identifying pairs of metabolites from KEGG [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref007" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref007">7</a>,
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref008" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref008">8</a>] that fit the chemical transformations associated with each of the four different oxidoreductase groups (Methods). We considered only compounds with fewer than 7 carbon atoms, thus generating a dataset consisting of 652 reactions: 83 reductions of category G1; 205 reductions of category G2; 104 reductions of category G3; and 260 reductions of category G4 (Supplementary Dataset 1). Some of these redox pairs are known to participate in enzyme-catalyzed reactions while others are hypothetical transformations that could potentially be performed by engineered enzymes. We note that our approach to generate reactions is similar to that of the comprehensive Atlas of Biochemistry [
  <a rid="pcbi.1006471.ref043" ref-type="bibr" href="#pcbi.1006471.ref043">43</a>], but we focus solely on the four redox transformations of interest.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006471.g003" href="#pcbi.1006471.g003">Fig 3</a> demonstrates that the value of E’

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The quantum chemical predictions further enable us to explore detailed structure-energy relationships within each of the general oxidoreductase groups. To exemplify this we focus on the G2 category, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006471.g004" href="#pcbi.1006471.g004">Fig 4</a>. While we find no significant difference between the average E’
  <span class="sup">m</span> of aldehydes and ketones, we can clearly see that the identity of functional groups adjacent to the carbonyl has a significant effect on E’
  <span class="sup">m</span>, as expected. Alpha ketoacids and dicarbonyls have a significantly higher E’
  <span class="sup">m</span> than alpha hydroxy-carbonyls (

   <span class="italic">m</span>
  </span>&gt; ≅ 35 
  <span class="italic">mV</span>,
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0005). Carbonyls next to double bonds or aromatic rings have a significantly lower E’
  <span class="sup">m</span> values than alpha hydroxy-carbonyls and carbonyls that are next to hydrocarbons (

  </span>&gt; ≅ −40 
  <span class="italic">mV</span> respectively, 
  <span class="italic">p</span> &lt; 0.0001). Lactones (cyclic esters), have redox potentials that are significantly lower than any other subgroup within the G2 category. As another validation of the predicted potentials, we found that the reduction potentials of open-chain sugars are significantly higher than those of closed-ring sugars that undergo ring opening upon reduction, where
