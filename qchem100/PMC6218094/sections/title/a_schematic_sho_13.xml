 <div class="title">A schematic showing the location of different types of oxidoreductase reactions (oxidoreductase groups 1 to 4) within the extended central metabolic network.</div>
 <p>We highlight reactions (purple) where a hydrocarbon is oxidized to a hydroxycarbon (G4 reactions, in the direction of oxidation) which generally cannot be sustained by NAD(P) as redox cofactor. See Supplementary Dataset 2 for full set of redox reactions in extended central metabolic network. G6P, Glucose-6-phosphate; F6P, Fructose-6-phosphate; DHAP, Dihydroxyacetone phosphate; GAP, Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate; Gly1P; Glycerol 1-phosphate; 6PG, 6-Phosphogluconolactone; R5P, Ribulose 5-phosphate; E4P, Erythrose 4-phosphate; 3PG, 3-Phosphoglycerate; PEP, Phosphoenolpyruvate; PYR, Pyruvate; AcCoA, Acetyl coenzyme A; 2KG, 2-Ketoglutaric acid; OA, Oxaloacetate.</p>
