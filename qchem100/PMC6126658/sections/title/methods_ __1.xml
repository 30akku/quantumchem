  <span class="italic">

  <sub>c(

  <sub>c(
   <span class="italic">ij</span>)
  </sub> values using equation (3
  <a href="#fd3">*</a>) assume the presence of a bond path, hence, a bond critical point (BCP), between the associated atom pairs. Whether such a path is present or not can in general only be determined through the ∇ρ vector field. In the case of the data used below, bond path and BCP occurrence are ensured by the original works (see the references in the
