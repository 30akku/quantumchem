 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photoluminescence measurements were performed on a fluorescence spectrofluorometer (QuantaMaster 40) equipped with a 75 W xenon arc lamp. Wavelengths were chosen by motorized excitation and emission monochromators with a bandwidth of 10 nm and 2 nm, respectively. Spectra were recorded by scanning emission with 1 nm resolution at each excitation wavelength. This procedure was iterated for the entire excitation range with 5 nm resolution. An integration time of 1 s was chosen. Sample temperature was fixed with a controlled Peltier element (identical to the previous). Data from CW spectroscopy were baseline corrected with the recorded blanks.</p>
