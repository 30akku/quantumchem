  <sub>4</sub> solution was prepared before each experimental series. The sample pH ranged from 2 to 11 and was adjusted by adding suitable amounts of NaOH and HClO
  <sub>4</sub> (Merck). The pH was measured directly after the luminescence measurements, to avoid quenching by chloride from the electrode. The pH measurements were carried out with a glass electrode (SenTix Mic, WTW), which was calibrated with 3 buffer solutions (NIST/PTB standard buffers).
