 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This method was developed as a robust analysis for a direct determination of unique explanatory factors. In this study explanatory factors correspond to chemical species. Anderson and Bro have shown that simultaneous analysis of multi-way data with three or more independent variables measured in a crossed fashion overcomes the rotation problem and a unique solution of such a model could be found.

  </span> It was demonstrated that PARAFAC is a useful tool for selective excitation luminescence spectroscopy

   <a rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit29">29</a>
  </span> as well as for TRLFS data.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the following section PARAFAC is illustrated using the example of TRLFS. Raw data were baseline corrected and normalized to a luminescence maximum of one before analysis to ensure equal weighting. Afterwards 2D data (emission wavelength 
  <span class="italic">versus</span> time) from measurements at different pH values were stacked to a 3D data cube (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, top). This data cube is a linear combination of individual cubes for respective chemical species (1 to 
  <span class="italic">f</span>) and additional noise (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, middle, adapted from Bro 
  <span class="italic">et al.</span>
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit31">31</a>
  </span>). Deconvolution with PARAFAC results in three matrices (A–C). The number of matrix columns equals the number of chemical species and the 
  <span class="italic">i</span>-th column of each matrix represents the 
  <span class="italic">i</span>-th species (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1</a>, bottom). Therefore the fraction of the 
  <span class="italic">i</span>-th chemical species within the data is explained by the vectors 
  <span class="italic">a</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>, 
  <span class="italic">b</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub> and 
  <span class="italic">c</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">i</span>
  </sub>. Each of the matrices contains intrinsic characteristics of chemical species along particular parameters (here pH, emission wavelength, and time) providing direct access to species distribution, luminescence spectra and luminescence decays.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">PARAFAC has already been implemented as the N-way Toolbox
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit27">27</a>
  </span> for the MATLAB software. Toolbox details can be found in literature

  </span> In this study PARAFAC was used for modelling uranyl(
  <span class="sc">vi</span>) hydrolysis data from TRLFS and CW spectroscopy and thus, chemical species correlate with uranyl(
  <span class="sc">vi</span>) complexes.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Unimodal (one maximum for speciation) and nonnegative (for luminescence spectra) constraints were used for the model as already implemented in the N-way Toolbox 3.31.
  <span class="sup">
   <a rid="cit27" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit27">27</a>
  </span> Based on the Optimization Toolbox a monoexponential constraint for the fluorescence decay was additionally implemented. Spectra and lifetimes were normalized directly by the PARAFAC algorithm. All Toolboxes were used with Matlab R2013a.
