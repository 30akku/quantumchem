 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A quadrupled (266 nm) Nd:YAG laser (minilite, Continuum) with 0.3 mJ per 4 ns pulse was used for excitation of the sample in a quartz glass cuvette. A light guide was used for transmission of emitted light to the spectrometer (Horiba, slit width 200 μm). A 100 lines per mm grate produced monochromatic light (resolution circa 0.5 nm) that was detected by a cooled (–20 °C) ICCD camera (Horiba). The initial delay was set to 0.1 μs and an aperture of 4 μs was used. An average of 75 accumulations was collected and the baseline correction was performed with the software LabSpec 5 (Horiba). A 150 ns step size for 148 spectra (setup 25 °C) and a 70 ns step size for 101 spectra (setup 1 °C) were used, respectively. Sample temperature was fixed with a controlled Peltier element (TC125 Temperature Control, Quantum Northwest).</p>
