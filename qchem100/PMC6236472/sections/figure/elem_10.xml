  <p>Gate savings associated with the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping normalized by the gate savings acquired using the same optimization with the Jordan–Wigner mapping, using the ancilla-based technique. Upper left: Total gate count. Upper right: Total gate count, zoomed. Lower left: Entangling gate count. Lower right: Entangling gate count, zoomed. Here, we again see roughly equivalent performance when using either a magnitude or lexicographic ordering. Once again, when using a alternative ordering, the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping is superior, however to a greatly reduced extent.</p>
