  <p>Relative Trotter error of Jordan–Wigner and Bravyi–Kitaev mappings as a function of gate count. The difference in error is normalized by the Jordan–Wigner error, such that a value of 0 indicates equivalent performance, with negative values implying high Bravyi–Kitaev error. Both schemes display remarkably similar errors for the magnitude ordering, likely due to the high degree of “physicality” of the ordering. For a lexicographic ordering, the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping shows lower error in most of the systems studied.</p>
