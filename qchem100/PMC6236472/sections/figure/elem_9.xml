  <p>Gate savings associated with the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping normalized by the gate savings acquired using the same optimization with the Jordan–Wigner mapping, using the modified basis change shift technique. Upper: Total gate count. Lower: Entangling gate count. Here we see that the Bravyi–Kitaev and Jordan–Wigner mappings perform relatively equivalently when using both lexicographic and magnitude orderings. Using an alternative ordering, the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping is superior, however these result in an overall increased gate count in both cases.</p>
