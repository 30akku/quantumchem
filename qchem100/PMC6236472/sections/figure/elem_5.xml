 <div class="caption">
  <p>Gate savings associated with the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping normalized by the gate savings acquired using the same optimization with the Jordan–Wigner mapping versus the number of spin–orbitals simulated, for various ordering schemes. A value of 0 indicates that the optimized Bravyi–Kitaev and optimized Jordan–Wigner circuits have equal number of gates. A value of 1 indicates that the optimized Bravyi–Kitaev mapping outperforms the optimized Jordan–Wigner mapping by a number of gates equal to that saved by performing optimization on the raw Jordan–Wigner circuit. Upper: total gates. Lower: entangling gates.</p>
