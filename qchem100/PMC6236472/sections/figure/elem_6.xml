  <p>Trotter error using the Bravyi–Kitaev mapping as a function of Jordan–Wigner circuit length, for different ordering schemes. Upper: Absolute Trotter error. Middle: Trotter error relative to error of lexicographic ordering. Note this excludes two instances where the relative Trotter error was &gt;20. The red line indicates a relative performance of 1 (i.e., below the line, the ordering results in a lower Trotter error than a lexicographic ordering). Note that the magnitude ordering usually results in a substantially lower error; however, in most of these cases, the Trotter error was already around 10
