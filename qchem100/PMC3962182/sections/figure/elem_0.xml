   <span class="bold">(left)</span> Depiction of the R-hydroxypropylthioethanesulfonate dehydrogenase (R-HPCDH) structure with those atoms most likely to undergo significant electronic reorganization or significantly contribute to this reorganization represented by a QM method (Ser142, Tyr155, Lys140, the R-HPC substrate and the nicotinamide moiety of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)) while the surroundings are represented by a MM force field. Solvent molecules not shown for clarity.
