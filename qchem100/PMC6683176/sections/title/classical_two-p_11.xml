  </span>. In brief, the pure liquid (or a liquid solution of the compound of interest) contained in a 1 cm path length quartz cuvette is excited with the output beam of a Ti:Sapphire femtosecond pulsed laser (KMLabs, 800 nm, Δt ~30 fs) with a 80 MHz repetition rate. The fluorescence emission was collected at a 90° angle to the excitation beam. Fluorescence emission at a selected wavelength was detected using a monochromator (ORIEL, Cornerstone 130) and a photomultiplier tube (Hamamatsu). The power of the 800 nm excitation beam was changed by using a variable neutral density filter.
