  </span>. Optimization of ground state geometries and calculation of molecular orbitals were completed with DFT using the B3LYP functional and 6–311 + G(2d,p) basis set. A previous study confirmed the accuracy of this functional and basis set for SEVO and another inhaled anesthetic, halothane

  </span>. We compared our optimized geometries, ground state dipole moments, and molecular orbitals with previous studies to confirm the accuracy of our calculations
