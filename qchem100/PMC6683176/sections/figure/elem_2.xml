  <p>Entangled photon interaction rate per molecule vs input photon rate for sevoflurane and isoflurane, with ZnTPP used as a standard. Classical two-photon results for sevoflurane and Coumarin 153 as a standard are shown in the inset. Error bars were calculated first for the sample and solvent transmission scans separately using the percent standard deviation of 50 single photon count measurements for toluene (a non-interacting solvent) at 4 different incident laser powers. This error was then propagated to calculate the interaction signal error bars.</p>
