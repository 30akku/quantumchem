  </div> QD has been found to be discernibly dependent on the noise-binding energy interplay. An increase in the magnetic field strength invariably reduces the magnitude of DMS; regardless of presence of noise. Both under noise-free condition and in presence of additive noise DMS declines as BE increases. However, a shift from additive to multiplicative mode of applying noise changes the scenario whence DMS displays clear enhancement with increase in BE. The findings show prolific means of regulating the DMS of doped QD system by appropriate control of noise-BE interaction.
