  </div> quantum dot (QD). 
  <span class="italic">Gaussian white noise</span> has been invoked for the above exploration. And Gaussian impurity acts as a dopant in the present study. The mode of inclusion of noise to the system significantly affects the above interplay and thus prominently modulates the DMS profile. The outcomes of the inspection unfolds the way by which DMS of doped QD can be regulated by prudent adjustment of noise-BE interaction.
