 <p>In traditional solar cells, photogenerated energetic carriers (so-called hot carriers) rapidly relax to band edges 
  <span class="italic">via</span> emission of phonons, prohibiting the extraction of their excess energy above the band gap. Quantum confined semiconductor nanocrystals, or quantum dots (QDs), were predicted to have long-lived hot carriers enabled by a phonon bottleneck, 
  <span class="italic">i.e.</span>, the large inter-level spacings in QDs should result in inefficient phonon emissions. Here we study the effect of quantum confinement on hot carrier/exciton lifetime in lead halide perovskite nanocrystals. We synthesized a series of strongly confined CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> nanocrystals with edge lengths down to 2.6 nm, the smallest reported to date, and studied their hot exciton relaxation using ultrafast spectroscopy. We observed sub-ps hot exciton lifetimes in all the samples with edge lengths within 2.6â€“6.2 nm and thus the absence of a phonon bottleneck. Their well-resolved excitonic peaks allowed us to quantify hot carrier/exciton energy loss rates which increased with decreasing NC sizes. This behavior can be well reproduced by a nonadiabatic transition mechanism between excitonic states induced by coupling to surface ligands.
