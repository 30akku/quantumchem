  <div class="title">(a) Absorption (colored lines) and first derivative of absorption (gray lines) spectra of NCs of varying sizes. The positions of X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub> on these spectra are labelled. (b) Transient absorption (TA) spectra of 
   <span class="italic">L</span> = 4.3 nm NCs at indicated delays following the excitation with a 430 nm pulse. The bleach feature B1 and absorptive feature A1 are labelled. (c) TA kinetics probed at the peaks of A1 (wine circles) and B1 (orange diamonds) are their single-exponential fits (solid lines).
