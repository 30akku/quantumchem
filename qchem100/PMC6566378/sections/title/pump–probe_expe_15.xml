 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The femtosecond pump–probe TA measurements were performed using a regenerative amplified Ti:sapphire laser system (Coherent; 800 nm, 70 fs, 6 mJ per pulse, and 1 kHz repetition rate) as the laser source and a Femto-100 spectrometer (Time-Tech LLC) as the spectrometer. Briefly, the 800 nm output pulse from the regenerative amplifier was split in two parts with a 50% beam splitter. The transmitted part was used to pump a TOPAS Optical Parametric Amplifier (OPA) which generated a wavelength-tunable laser pulse from 250 nm to 2.5 μm as the pump beam. The reflected 800 nm beam was split again into two parts. One part with less than 10% was attenuated with a neutral density filter and focused into a 2 mm thick sapphire or CaF
  <sub>2</sub> window to generate a white light continuum (WLC) used as the probe beam. The probe beam was focused with an Al parabolic reflector onto the sample. After the sample, the probe beam was collimated and then focused into a fiber-coupled spectrometer with CMOS sensors and detected at a frequency of 1 kHz. The intensity of the pump pulse used in the experiment was controlled using a variable neutral-density filter wheel. The delay between the pump and probe pulses was controlled using a motorized delay stage. The pump pulses were chopped using a synchronized chopper at 500 Hz and the absorbance change was calculated with two adjacent probe pulses (pump-blocked and pump-unblocked). The samples were placed in 1 mm cuvettes and were vigorously stirred in all the measurements.
