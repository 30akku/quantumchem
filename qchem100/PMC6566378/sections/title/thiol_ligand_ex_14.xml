  <a rid="cit45" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit45">45</a> 2 mL 1-dodecanethiol (DDT) and 5 mL hexane were vacuum-dried for 1 h at 100 °C using a Schlenk line to remove the moisture before the diluted 1-dodecanethiol solution was kept at 50 °C under an argon atmosphere. In a typical reaction, the pristine CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs dispersed in hexane (2 mL) with oleic acid (OA) ligands were transferred into a sealed and argon-purged 4 mL chromatographic bottle, into which 0.1 mL dried DDT–hexane solution was injected. The mixture was sonicated at 50 °C for 2 h for ligand exchange.
