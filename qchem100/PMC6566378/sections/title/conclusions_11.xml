 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we measured size-dependent hot exciton relaxation dynamics in mono-disperse and strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs using TA spectroscopy and found the absence of a phonon bottleneck. Their well-resolved excitonic peaks allowed us to calculate size-dependent energy loss rates. The energy loss mechanism for CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs is inconsistent with that proposed for both CdSe (electron-to-hole energy transfer) and PbSe QDs (nonadiabatic multi-phonon emission). Energy transfer to surface ligands is not the dominant mechanism either, because NCs capped with ligands of low and high infrared absorbances at the X
  <sub>2</sub> to X
  <sub>1</sub> transition energy showed essentially the same relaxation dynamics. Rather, hot exciton relaxation in strongly confined CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs is likely dominated by a nonadiabatic transition mechanism induced by surface ligands. Smaller NCs have stronger quantum confinement and thus higher wavefunction amplitude at NC surfaces, thus enhancing their interaction with the nuclear coordinates of surface ligands and bypassing the otherwise expected phonon bottleneck. This study highlights the difficulty of achieving long-lived hot carriers even in strongly confined perovskite NCs, due to the ligand-induced nonadiabatic transition mechanism that universally exists for colloidal NCs.
