 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We synthesized mono-disperse CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs with varying sizes by modifying recent literature methods;
  <a rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit29">29</a>,
  <a rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit33">33</a> details can be found in the Methods section. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of these NCs are presented in Fig. S1 in the ESI.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">‡</a> The edge lengths (
  <span class="italic">L</span>) of these cube-shaped NCs are in the range of 2.6 to 6.2 nm (
  <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), which are smaller than the Bohr exciton diameter of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> (∼7 nm (
  <a rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit28">ref. 28</a>)), and hence, all samples fall in the strong quantum confinement regime.
  <a rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit34">34</a> Due to the relatively precise control of their sizes, these NCs exhibit well-defined excitonic peaks in their absorption spectra (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1a</a>). In particular, the two lowest energy peaks can be well-resolved, which are labelled X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub>. According to a recent study,
  <a rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit35">35</a> X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub> can be assigned to transitions from the first and second hole levels in the valence band to the first and second electron levels in the conduction band, respectively. The exact peak positions for X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub> were determined from the zero-crossing points on the first derivative curves of absorption spectra (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1a</a>). Particularly noteworthy is the 
  <span class="italic">L</span> = 2.6 nm sample, which is the smallest size of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs reported to date and thus has the strongest quantum confinement (with X
  <sub>1</sub> at ∼439 nm). In previous studies, the smallest size reported was ∼3.0 nm (with X
  <sub>1</sub> at ∼451 nm).
  <a rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit28">28</a> The energy separations between X
  <sub>1</sub> and X
  <sub>2</sub> (Δ
  <span class="italic">E</span>) in the samples are in the range of 0.18 eV to 0.32 eV, increasing with decreasing NC sizes (

  <sub>3</sub> NCs using pump–probe TA spectroscopy; see the Methods section for details. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1b</a> shows the TA spectra of 
  <span class="italic">L</span> = 4.3 nm NCs within 1 ps following the excitation by a 430 nm pump pulse which selectively excites X
  <sub>2</sub>. The excitation energy densities were maintained low enough in all TA experiments such that single exciton dynamics were detected.
  <a rid="cit36" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit36">36</a> In the examined time window, TA spectra are dominated by an exciton bleach (B1) feature at ∼470 nm and an induced absorption (A1) at ∼490 nm. B1 can be assigned to the state-filling effect by band edge excitons (both electrons and holes),
  <a rid="cit37" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit37">37</a>,
  <a rid="cit38" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit38">38</a> whereas A1 is often attributed to Stark-effect-like signals arising from interactions between hot and band edge excitons.
  <a rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit17">17</a>,
  <a rid="cit39" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit39">39</a>–
  <a rid="cit41" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit41">41</a> As a result, in the course of hot exciton relaxation to form band edge excitons, the growth of B1 is accompanied by the decay of A1, as observed in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1c</a>. By simultaneously fitting the kinetics probed at these two features, the X
  <sub>2</sub> to X
  <sub>1</sub> relaxation time constant is determined to be 
  <span class="italic">τ</span>
  <sub>r</sub> = 410 ± 30 fs. This fast relaxation is similar to that previously reported for bulk-like CsPbBr

  <a rid="cit17" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit17">17</a>–
  <a rid="cit20" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit20">20</a> indicating that quantum confinement does not slow down hot exciton relaxation in these NCs and that there are relaxation mechanisms bypassing the phonon bottleneck which, however, are overlooked in the calculations in 
  <a rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit26">ref. 26</a>. The hot carrier energy loss rate (d
  <span class="italic">E</span>/d
  <span class="italic">t</span>) can be estimated as Δ
  <span class="italic">E</span>/2
  <span class="italic">τ</span>
  <sub>r</sub>, with the factor 2 arising from the assumption of symmetric electron and hole confinement energies, and is 0.32 ± 0.02 eV ps
  <span class="sup">–1</span> for this 
  <span class="italic">L</span> = 4.3 nm sample. We calculated hot carrier instead of hot exciton energy loss rates simply because previous studies on CdSe
  <a rid="cit23" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit23">23</a> and PbSe
  <a rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit30">30</a> QDs reported hot carrier energy loss rates; see discussions below.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We notice that excitation at 400 nm generates similar hot carrier relaxation dynamics to the case of 430 nm excitation (Fig. S2
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">‡</a>), suggesting that the relaxation from X
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">n</span>
  </sub> (
  <span class="italic">n</span> ≥ 3) to X
  <sub>2</sub> occurs at a much faster rate than that from X
  <sub>2</sub> to X
  <sub>1</sub>. Thus, the relaxation from X
  <sub>2</sub> to X
  <sub>1</sub> is the rate determining step (RDS) in the complicated multi-step hot exciton relaxation process. Similar observations were found for other samples, such as the 
  <span class="italic">L</span> = 4.0 nm and 
  <span class="italic">L</span> = 4.5 nm NCs shown in Fig. S2.
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">‡</a> It also justifies previous reports in which the same excitation wavelength such as 400 nm was used to determine hot exciton relaxation times in samples with different band edge exciton energy.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Hot exciton relaxation dynamics in CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs of other sizes were also measured using TA (see Fig. S3–S9
  <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">‡</a>) to extract their hot exciton relaxation time constants (

  <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a> and 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Fig. 2a</a>). In contrast, hot carrier energy loss rates increase with decreasing NC sizes (

  <sub>3</sub> NCs with previously reported spherical QDs, we define 
  <span class="italic">R</span> = 
  <span class="italic">L</span>/2 for these NCs. In general, the hot carrier energy loss rate in CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs is slower than that in CdSe QDs of comparable sizes. In contrast, there exists a cross-over between CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs and PbSe QDs; the rate is slightly faster in CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> NCs for 
  <span class="italic">R</span> &lt; 2 nm whereas it becomes faster in PbSe QDs for
