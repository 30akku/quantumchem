  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We synthesized mono-disperse CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs with varying sizes by modifying recent literature methods;
   <a rid="cit29" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit29">29</a>,
   <a rid="cit33" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit33">33</a> details can be found in the Methods section. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images of these NCs are presented in Fig. S1 in the ESI.
   <a ref-type="fn" rid="fn2" href="#fn2">‡</a> The edge lengths (
   <span class="italic">L</span>) of these cube-shaped NCs are in the range of 2.6 to 6.2 nm (
   <a rid="tab1" ref-type="table" href="#tab1">Table 1</a>), which are smaller than the Bohr exciton diameter of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> (∼7 nm (
   <a rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit28">ref. 28</a>)), and hence, all samples fall in the strong quantum confinement regime.
   <a rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit34">34</a> Due to the relatively precise control of their sizes, these NCs exhibit well-defined excitonic peaks in their absorption spectra (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1a</a>). In particular, the two lowest energy peaks can be well-resolved, which are labelled X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub>. According to a recent study,
   <a rid="cit35" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit35">35</a> X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub> can be assigned to transitions from the first and second hole levels in the valence band to the first and second electron levels in the conduction band, respectively. The exact peak positions for X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub> were determined from the zero-crossing points on the first derivative curves of absorption spectra (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig1" href="#fig1">Fig. 1a</a>). Particularly noteworthy is the 
   <span class="italic">L</span> = 2.6 nm sample, which is the smallest size of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs reported to date and thus has the strongest quantum confinement (with X
   <sub>1</sub> at ∼439 nm). In previous studies, the smallest size reported was ∼3.0 nm (with X
   <sub>1</sub> at ∼451 nm).
   <a rid="cit28" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit28">28</a> The energy separations between X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub> (Δ

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We examine possible mechanisms for the ultrafast hot exciton relaxation dynamics observed in CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs. As we mentioned in the Introduction, hot electron relaxation in II–VI group QDs (such as CdSe) has been attributed to the Auger-type, electron-to-hole energy transfer mechanism,
   <a rid="cit24" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit24">24</a>,
   <a rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit25">25</a> because holes in these QDs can quickly relax 
   <span class="italic">via</span> emission of phonons due to the high density of states in the valence band.
   <a rid="cit34" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit34">34</a> This mechanism should not be applicable for CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs. Because of similar conduction and valence band structures near their edges and electron and hole effective masses,
   <a rid="cit12" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit12">12</a> both electron and hole energy levels in quantum-confined CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs should be discrete. This situation is similar to IV–VI group QDs (such as PbSe). The absence of the Auger relaxation mechanism might be responsible for the slower hot carrier energy loss rates of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs and PbSe QDs than that of CdSe QDs plotted in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Fig. 2b</a>. Still, the energy loss rates of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs and PbSe QDs are fast, only several fold slower than that of CdSe, suggesting alternative hot carrier/exciton cooling mechanisms in CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> and PbSe.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For PbSe QDs, a multi-phonon emission mechanism was proposed to account for the ultrafast hot carrier/exciton relaxation.
   <a rid="cit30" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit30">30</a> This mechanism is enabled by intrinsic nonadiabatic interactions induced by electron–lattice coupling and it requires thermal activation to cross the intersection point between 1

   <a rid="cit31" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit31">ref. 31</a>, we calculated wavefunctions for X
   <sub>1</sub> and X
   <sub>2</sub> using effective mass approximation (EMA) and obtained their surface fraction (

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In principle, hot carrier/exciton relaxation 
   <span class="italic">via</span> nonadiabatic transition induced by surface ligands should be universal for quantum-confined colloidal NCs. As such, this channel is also active for CdSe and PbSe QDs. For CdSe QDs, however, the Auger-type, electron-to-hole energy transfer adds an extra and dominant channel for hot electron relaxation, which explains their faster energy loss rates than PbSe QDs and CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs. PbSe QDs have similar but slightly lower hot carrier energy loss rates than CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs for 
   <span class="italic">R</span> &gt; 2 nm in which regime both are likely dominated by the ligand-induced nonadiabatic mechanism. However, PbSe QDs have yet another lattice-induced nonadiabatic mechanism which is also strongly enhanced by quantum confinement; as a result, their hot carrier energy loss rates become faster than those of CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs when 
   <span class="italic">R</span> &lt; 2 nm. These explanations qualitatively rationalize the comparison shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Fig. 2b</a>. Nonetheless, several unknowns remain to be elucidated for a more quantitative interpretation of 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Fig. 2b</a>. The first one is related to how to quantify the ligand-induced nonadiabatic relaxation rates for NCs of different compositions. This would explain the slightly slower hot carrier energy loss rates in PbSe QDs than in CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs for 
   <span class="italic">R</span> &gt; 2 nm. Another unknown is why the lattice-induced nonadiabatic mechanism is significant in PbSe QDs but not in CdSe QDs and CsPbBr
   <sub>3</sub> NCs.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A more general issue associated with the study of hot carrier dynamics of colloidal NCs is how to disentangle the various hot carrier relaxation mechanisms and how to determine the absolute rate for each individual pathway. According to the unified relaxation picture established by Kambhampati 
   <span class="italic">et al.</span>,
   <a rid="cit40" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit40">40</a>,
   <a rid="cit41" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit41">41</a> in many cases these mechanisms co-exist and thus it is very difficult to cleanly separate them. Experimental studies with more extensively tuned relaxation-related parameters (NC size, electronic structure, temperature, 
   <span class="italic">etc.</span>) combined with high-level theories would be required for this goal, which is beyond the scope of this work. The focus here is to unravel the dominant hot carrier relaxation mechanism responsible for the absence of a phonon bottleneck in strongly confined perovskite NCs.
