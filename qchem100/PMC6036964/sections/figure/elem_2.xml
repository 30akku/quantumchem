  <p>FTIR spectra of the supersonic expansion of methanol (MeOH) and phenyl vinyl ether (PVE) at different concentrations in helium. The spectra are spread out along the ordinate to improve visualization. Only one dominant mixed dimer band is visible in the spectra, lying at 3625 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (marked MeOH + PVE) between the methanol monomer at 3686 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> (MeOH) and methanol dimer at 3575 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> ((MeOH)
   <sub>2</sub>). By comparing the spectrum at the top with the other two spectra recorded at reduced concentrations of methanol (middle) or methanol and PVE (bottom), the further downshifted band at 3466 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> can be attributed to a higher cluster, probably a methanol-rich mixed trimer ((MeOH)
   <sub>2</sub> + PVE (?)), due to its scaling with the variation of the concentrations.
