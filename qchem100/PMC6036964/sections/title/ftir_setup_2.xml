 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the FTIR experiments, the so-called filet-jet setup, as described in detail in [
  <a rid="R49" ref-type="bibr" href="#R49">49</a>], was used. In this setup, the scans of a Bruker IFS 66 v/s spectrometer (80 kHz, resolution 2 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) are synchronized to a pulsed supersonic expansion through a 600 × 0.2 mm
  <span class="sup">2</span> slit nozzle. Using two separate cooled saturators, low concentrations (&lt;0.1%) of PVE (Sigma-Aldrich, 97%, used as purchased) and methanol (Sigma-Aldrich, ≥99.8%, used as purchased) were added to the carrier gas helium (Linde, 99.996%) and premixed at a pressure of 0.75 bar in a 67 L reservoir before being expanded through the slit nozzle. The pulsed operation with waiting times of 30–90 s between 150 ms long pulses combined with a buffer volume of 12–23 m
  <span class="sup">3</span> and a pumping capacity of 500–2500 m
  <span class="sup">3</span>/h resulted in background pressures of less than 0.1 mbar before expansions. This facilitated measurements of clusters of methanol and PVE in the zone of silence of the expansion at an average distance of 10 mm to the nozzle. A calcium fluoride beam splitter, lenses and windows were used in combination with a 150 W tungsten filament and an optical filter (4200–2450 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in the OH stretching range of the vibrational spectra. For the final spectra, 150 to 775 pulses were co-added to further improve signal-to-noise.
