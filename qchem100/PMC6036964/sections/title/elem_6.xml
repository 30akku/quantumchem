  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast to the already studied diphenyl ether–alcohol clusters [

   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>], phenyl vinyl ether offers three different binding sites for possible interactions with small solvent molecules: the ether oxygen, the phenyl ring and the vinyl moiety. Since both the phenyl ring and the vinyl moiety interact with the solvent via a π cloud, preferred binding sites are indicated using the following nomenclature: P (phenyl) and E (ethenyl), respectively. The optimizations using B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP yield six different structures, representing each binding motif with two isomers (cf. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to verify the structures of the complexes, a second level of theory was applied, namely SCS-CC2/def2-TZVP. Similar minima were found in the latter calculations, confirming the rich variety of binding motifs. However, distinct differences were found between the two methods: While B3LYP-D3 predicted the OH–E conformer as the most stable complex SCS-CC2 gave OH–P as the lowest minimum (cf. Table S1 in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>). This is in contrast to our results of diphenyl ether–alcohol clusters [
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>–
   <a rid="R20" ref-type="bibr" href="#R20">20</a>
   <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>], where both computational levels predicted the same energetic order of the isomers. The two structures correspond to quite different docking positions, reflecting well the demanding test this system imposes on quantum chemical methods. Several minima are separated by energy differences of 1 kJ/mol or less. The complete energetic analysis at both levels of theory is presented in 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a> (cf. Tables S1 and S2). The reasons behind the discrepancies are manifold, ranging from the method to the small basis set used. In order to obtain a more reliable theoretical prediction, LCCSD(T0)-F12/CBS[T:Q] calculations were carried out on top of the DFT-optimized geometries. The results are presented in 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>, with and without zero-point vibrational energy (ZPVE) corrections.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The coupled cluster results show a clear energetic preference for the OH–O and OH–O’ isomers. Observing the intermolecular contacts, which may or may not be designated as weak hydrogen bonds but are expected to stabilize the complexes, the main difference between the two structures is a phenyl vs ethenyl CH to methanol O contact (cf. dashed gray lines in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). Both are separated by only a few tenths of a kJ/mol, which is within the error of the method used (considering that the coupled cluster expansion is truncated at triples excitations and the neglect of core-valence correlation effects, which should be the largest sources of error along with the harmonic B3LYP ZPVE error). It also confirmed the subtle difference between the six conformers, with an energy span of approximately 4–5 kJ/mol (≈1 kcal/mol, the commonly accepted definition of chemical accuracy) among all structures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Also featured in 
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a> are the computed O–H stretch fundamentals together with the IR intensity at the two different levels of theory used in the optimizations. The frequencies were scaled according to the experimental value of the OH–π isomer of DPE–MeOH [
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>]. Based on the computational results, the vibrational spectral signals of the OH–O and OH–O’ isomers will be extremely hard to distinguish, as they lie less than 3 cm
   <span class="sup">−1</span> apart, with very similar intensities. The same can be asserted for the less stable OH–E and OH–E’ structures. This is not surprising, given the similarities of the OH binding pattern for both sets of structures.
  </p>
  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to gain further insight into the energetic order of the different isomers, we conducted an analysis of the dispersion interactions present in the system by decomposing the CCSD energy terms obtained with the largest basis set (VQZ-F12). The latter procedure is based on the classification of the intermolecular excitation classes as detailed in [
   <a rid="R48" ref-type="bibr" href="#R48">48</a>,
   <a rid="R67" ref-type="bibr" href="#R67">67</a>]. The results are shown in 
   <a rid="T2" ref-type="table" href="#T2">Table 2</a>. Beyond the total dispersion contributions, we also made use of the local analysis to separate the contribution of different molecular moieties in the PVE molecule (phenyl, ether oxygen and ethenyl). Shared orbitals are split up according to their NPA (natural population analysis) charges as described in [
   <a rid="R68" ref-type="bibr" href="#R68">68</a>].

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dispersion interaction energies show an interesting pattern. Although all structures are significantly stabilized by dispersion, with a maximum energy difference of 2.6 kJ/mol when summed all together, the relative weight of the different molecular fragments varies quite significantly. The moiety with the largest potential as dispersion energy donor (DED) is the phenyl ring. This results in the strongest stabilization for the two conformers whereby the methanol is closest to the ring (OH–P and OH–P’). The other conformers have much more spread out contributions. What is surprising is that even for the ethenyl binding complexes the contribution of the phenyl ring is sizeable. Geometrically, this seems unlikely, given that the methanol moiety is not oriented favorably relative to the ring. The effect can, however, be understood by inspecting the respective dispersion interaction densities (DIDs, cf. 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>), which allow for an even finer-grained analysis. There, one can observe that the major contributor is not the π-system of the phenyl ring, but a C–H contact to the methanol (a similar effect had already been observed in diphenyl ether–methanol complexes [
   <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>]). This contact is reminiscent of stabilization effects observed in coupled diamondoids [
   <a rid="R69" ref-type="bibr" href="#R69">69</a>] or supramolecular complexes [
   <a rid="R70" ref-type="bibr" href="#R70">70</a>], where such interactions can be found in large numbers.

    <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>), this would imply a single docking motif, as different docking motifs are predicted to lead to larger spectral separations. However, different extents of anharmonicity do not allow to completely ruling out overlapping docking motifs. Therefore, conformationally selective methods are desirable to investigate this possibility. Finally, the actual docking site has to be identified by structural or electronic excitation spectroscopy.

    <a rid="T3" ref-type="table" href="#T3">Table 3</a>) for the two isomers agree the best with the values calculated for the OH–O’ isomer (as also indicated in the FTIR and the IR–UV investigations, which are, however, unable to distinguish OH–O from OH–O’) and the OH–P isomer, respectively. The identification of the two complexes to the OH–O’ and the OH–P isomers is guided by the absolute and relative values of the B and C rotational constants. Generally, the rotational constants calculated at the SCS-CC2/def2-TZVP level of theory agree somewhat better with the experimental values than the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP values (note that we compare experimental 
    <span class="italic">B</span>
    <sub>0</sub> rotational constants with theoretical 
    <span class="italic">B</span>
    <sub>e</sub> rotational constants here). For the OH–P complex, however, we find that the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/def2-TZVP level of theory provides a better prediction of the magnitudes of the dipole-moment components. Experimentally, we only observe a-type transitions for this complex, which points to rather low values for μ
    <sub>b</sub> and μ
    <sub>c</sub>. SCS-CC2 calculations predict all three dipole-moment components to be of comparable magnitude. At the B3LYP-D3(BJ) level, μ
    <sub>a</sub> is predicted to be significantly stronger than μ
    <sub>b</sub> and μ
    <sub>c</sub>. This change in magnitude for the dipole-moment components for different levels of calculation is more often observed for weakly bound complexes because the exact arrangement of the two monomers with respect to each other can have a major influence on the dipole-moment components. Also note that in none of the spectroscopic experiments, we observe the OH–E isomer that is also predicted to be of relatively low energy (cf

For the OH–P isomer (complex 2), no line splitting due to internal rotation was observed. This is consistent with the higher barrier for this motion due to the secondary interactions of the methyl group with PVE (cf.

In addition, we used the program XIAM to perform a global fit including both A and E lines. This global fit does not only provide the rotational constants, but also parameters of the internal rotor, in this case the methyl group. This includes the barrier height for internal rotation as well as the geometrical arrangement of the rotor with respect to the overall rotating molecule, as also discussed for the DPE–MeOH complex [
    <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>]. For PVE–MeOH, the barrier height was determined to be 261 cm
    <span class="sup">−1</span>, as summarized in Table S9 of 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>. This value is in agreement to barrier heights observed for other complexes with methanol [

    <span class="italic">.</span> Table S9, 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>). This somewhat lower methyl group internal rotation barrier for the OH–O’ isomer could point to a softening of the C–O bond of methanol due to the hydrogen bond. The DID plots in 
    <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a> also indicate that the methyl group is basically free from other interactions, so that no additional hindering is expected.

   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, the transition intensities for the OH–O’ isomer are strong enough (with a signal-to-noise (SNR) of about 500:1 to 600:1 for the stronger transitions) to assign rotational transitions arising from all nine singly substituted

   </p>
   <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As mentioned, the OH–O’ isomer is about ten times more intense than the OH–P isomer. The intensity observed in CP-FTMW spectroscopy directly depends on the number of molecules, i.e., the population of the respective isomers, as well as the square of the transition dipole moments. Since the μ
    <sub>a</sub> values for the two isomers differ by a factor of two (cf
    <span class="italic">.</span> Table S11 in 
    <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>), the OH–P isomer can be considered to be about 2.5 times less populated than the OH–O’ isomer, as an upper estimate. Taking the predicted energy difference of 0.8 kJ/mol for granted, this ratio would correspond to a plausible [
    <a rid="R18" ref-type="bibr" href="#R18">18</a>] conformational freezing temperature of 100 K. A three-fold lower or three-fold higher conformational temperature appears unlikely, and thus a tentative experimental energy penalty for OH–P relative to OH–O’ ranges from 0.3 to 2 kJ/mol. This contradicts both inexpensive approaches (B3LYP-D3 and SCS-CC2 with def2-TZVP) and suggests that these methods somewhat underestimate the stability of OH∙∙∙O contacts.

   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>). The spectral shift can be explained by regarding the HOMO and LUMO orbitals involved in the S
   <sub>1</sub>←S
   <sub>0</sub> transition, which is predicted to be mainly a π–π* transition with a small charge transfer contribution from the ether oxygen to the phenyl ring. The latter leads to a slightly decreased electron density at the binding site for the methanol molecule and therefore weakens the hydrogen bond. These findings are in line with observations in previous studies on diphenyl ether–alcohol complexes [

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In principle, as the OH–O’ isomer has been identified in the S
   <sub>0</sub> state, the observation of a respective OH∙∙∙O-bound structure can be expected in the S
   <sub>1</sub> state as well. However, the OH–P isomers are predicted to be significantly stabilized in the S
   <sub>1</sub> state (cf
   <span class="italic">.</span> Table S2, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>). Nevertheless, due to the predicted red-shifts of the OH stretching frequencies of the OH–P isomers (indicating an increased hydrogen bond strength compared to the S
   <sub>0</sub> state), their presence, i.e., by a rearrangement reaction from the OH–O’ isomer, can be excluded. By exciting the electronic origin of the OH–O’ isomer the formation of OH–E isomers can also be excluded as their expected excitation energies are higher than the one for OH–O’ and in addition they are energetically less stable (cf
