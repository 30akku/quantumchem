  <p>Purity of remotely prepared states in phase space. The phase space of the prepared states is spanned by 
   <span class="italic">S</span>
   <sub>rp</sub> and

   <sub>rp</sub>. The gray area marks squeezing below the vacuum limit. The color code indicates the purity 
   <span class="italic">μ</span> of the remotely prepared states. The optimal point is marked by the white star. The inset shows the Wigner function 1/
   <span class="italic">e</span> contours of the experimental state at the optimal point with 
   <span class="italic">μ</span> = 0.54 and a pure squeezed state with the same squeezing level. The vacuum 1/
