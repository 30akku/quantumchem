 <p id="Par2">Continuous-variable remote state preparation in the microwave domain would allow to leverage the superconducting technology for quantum networks applications. Here, the authors show how to deterministically prepare squeezed Gaussian states across 35â€‰cm using previously shared entanglement.</p>
