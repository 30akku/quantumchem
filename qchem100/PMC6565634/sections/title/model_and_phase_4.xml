 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our experiment can be theoretically described by a model based on the input-output transformations for every component in the setup including transmission losses. In particular, we define

  <sub>1</sub> as the total loss between JPA 1 (or JPA 2) and JPA 3, and 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <sub>2</sub> as the total loss between JPA 1 (or JPA 2) and the directional coupler. This definition implies that all path losses between JPA 1 or JPA 2 and any component after the beam splitter are assumed to be equal (Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>). Additionally, we assume imperfect JPAs adding a certain amount of noise with mean thermal photon numbers

  <span class="italic">σ</span> is the covariance matrix of the remotely prepared state, incorporates the information about the antisqueezed quadrature and is a measure of how close the state is to a pure state. For application scenarios where pure states are desired, the performance of RSP can be best quantified by the purity. It vanishes for maximally mixed states and is unity for a pure state. We achieve the highest uncorrected purity 
  <span class="italic">μ</span> = 0.54 ± 0.01 at the optimal point which is sufficient for many applications of squeezed states such as entanglement generation

  </span>, and quantum illumination

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38" href="#CR38">38</a>
  </span>. Using appropriate modeling of our experiment, we are able to investigate the effect of imperfections in different parts of the protocol on the purity of the prepared state at the optimal point. If the resource TMS state is pure and distributed ideally to Alice and Bob, the model predicts an improved purity of 0.60 for otherwise unchanged parameters. Alternatively, ideal operations of Alice and Bob (noiseless JPA 3 combined with no losses on Alice’s and Bob’s sides) with a realistic entangled resource would yield a purity of 0.62. Overall, the observed purity is limited by the added noise of the JPAs and the losses in the setup. Upon reducing the JPA noise photon numbers by one order of magnitude as well as the total losses to 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <sub>1</sub> = 
  <span class="italic">χ</span>
  <sub>2</sub> = 0.05 (0.2 dB), we expect an optimized purity 
  <span class="italic">μ</span>
  <sub>opt</sub> = 0.80 for the prepared state at the optimal point. The reduction of losses can be achieved by using a superconducting hybrid ring, optimized cable connectors, and improved circulators. In this context, one should remember that our protocol allows for the preparation of continuous-variable squeezed states with a degree of squeezing 
  <span class="italic">S</span>
