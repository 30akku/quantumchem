 <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The general idea behind the RSP protocol and our experimental implementation using continuous-variable microwave states are described in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>. We use flux-driven Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPAs) as the key elements for the generation and manipulation of squeezed microwave states

This number quantifies the strength of nonlocal correlations present between field quadratures of signals propagating along different beam splitter output paths. Additionally, the symmetric TMS states have negligible local squeezing within each path. In other words, the microwave signals propagating on the two paths locally look like thermal states with, nevertheless, strong entanglement between them (see Supplementary Note

 <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next step, we employ the symmetric propagating TMS states as a resource for remotely preparing the target squeezed microwave states. For this purpose, the TMS states are continuously distributed between two parties, Alice and Bob, who are separated by 35 of superconducting cable. Alice generates a feedforward signal carrying the classical information about her choice on what quantum state is to be remotely prepared at Bob’s side. Finally, Bob displaces his part of the resource state proportionally to the communicated signal by using a directional coupler with a fixed coupling of 
  <span class="italic">β</span> ≃ −15 dB
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
  </span>. We experimentally implement the feedforward by operating JPA 3 as a phase-sensitive amplifier. Alice uses it to choose and strongly amplify a certain quadrature of the incoming TMS states. Note that, in contrast to the other JPAs, it does not matter whether the outgoing feedforward signal from JPA 3 is squeezed or not (Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The essential classical information, as required for a successful RSP, is encoded in the large instantaneous amplitude of the phase-sensitively amplified field quadrature. For ideal RSP, the coupling 
  <span class="italic">β</span> should be vanishingly small. However, since 
  <span class="italic">β</span> needs to be approximately compensated by the degenerate gain of JPA 3, we are limited to a certain range of 
  <span class="italic">β</span> values due to the noise and gain performance of JPA 3.
