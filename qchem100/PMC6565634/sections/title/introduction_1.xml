 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In quantum technology, an efficient and secure exchange of quantum information between quantum nodes plays a crucial role
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1" href="#CR1">1</a>
  </span>. One of the first protocols realizing such a task was quantum teleportation, where an unknown quantum state is safely transferred from one party to another by using a shared entangled resource and classical feedforward
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3" href="#CR3">3</a>
  </span>. In a different scenario, where one party has full classical knowledge about a to-be-communicated quantum state, remote state preparation (RSP) can be used to remotely create this quantum state by employing similar tools as in quantum teleportation
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4" href="#CR4">4</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7" href="#CR7">7</a>
  </span>. Compared to known classical methods, both protocols provide a quantum advantage as they require a smaller amount of classical information in the feedforward signal in order to communicate a desired quantum state
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. However, in contrast to quantum teleportation, RSP allows for a nontrivial trade-off between the amount of classical communication and entanglement necessary for a successful protocol
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
  </span>. Furthermore, the use of an entangled resource allows RSP to operate perfectly secure
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8" href="#CR8">8</a>
  </span>. Even though RSP is extensively investigated both theoretically and experimentally for discrete-variable systems

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9" href="#CR9">9</a>–
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11" href="#CR11">11</a>
  </span>, deterministic implementations with continuous-variable systems are still lacking

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13" href="#CR13">13</a>
  </span>. At the same time, quantum communication based on continuous-variables is a field of intense research

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Quantum communication in the microwave domain is motivated by the tremendous progress in the area of quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In particular, the development of superconducting multi-qubit processors
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
  </span>, operated at gigahertz frequencies has been highly successful. We promote an approach of quantum communication directly in the microwave regime based on propagating squeezed states. Since these states have the same frequency and are generated by technology platforms already used for superconducting quantum computers, there is no mismatch between communication and data processing units. This approach is expected to be useful for short and medium distances, where superconducting waveguides can be used.

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, we realize deterministic continuous-variable RSP by creating Gaussian squeezed states with tunable squeezing level and squeezing angle over a distance of 35 cm. We investigate the phase space of remotely preparable squeezed states and obtain good agreement with our model calculations based on the input-output formalism. Additionally, we find that our scheme corresponds to an extension of the one-time pad cryptographic protocol
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>
  </span> into the quantum regime which allows for information-theoretic security. In contrast to already demonstrated quantum state transfer protocols between superconducting circuits

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
  </span>, our protocol does not directly transmit the target states to the receiving party. Moreover, it can be operated in the continuous regime and utilizes preshared entanglement to enable secure communication between parties. Since the generation and manipulation of Gaussian states is well understood
