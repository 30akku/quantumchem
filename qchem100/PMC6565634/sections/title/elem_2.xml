  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the next step, we employ the symmetric propagating TMS states as a resource for remotely preparing the target squeezed microwave states. For this purpose, the TMS states are continuously distributed between two parties, Alice and Bob, who are separated by 35 of superconducting cable. Alice generates a feedforward signal carrying the classical information about her choice on what quantum state is to be remotely prepared at Bob’s side. Finally, Bob displaces his part of the resource state proportionally to the communicated signal by using a directional coupler with a fixed coupling of 
   <span class="italic">β</span> ≃ −15 dB
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34" href="#CR34">34</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35" href="#CR35">35</a>
   </span>. We experimentally implement the feedforward by operating JPA 3 as a phase-sensitive amplifier. Alice uses it to choose and strongly amplify a certain quadrature of the incoming TMS states. Note that, in contrast to the other JPAs, it does not matter whether the outgoing feedforward signal from JPA 3 is squeezed or not (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The essential classical information, as required for a successful RSP, is encoded in the large instantaneous amplitude of the phase-sensitively amplified field quadrature. For ideal RSP, the coupling 
   <span class="italic">β</span> should be vanishingly small. However, since 
   <span class="italic">β</span> needs to be approximately compensated by the degenerate gain of JPA 3, we are limited to a certain range of 
   <span class="italic">β</span> values due to the noise and gain performance of JPA 3.

Using appropriate modeling of our experiment, we are able to investigate the effect of imperfections in different parts of the protocol on the purity of the prepared state at the optimal point. If the resource TMS state is pure and distributed ideally to Alice and Bob, the model predicts an improved purity of 0.60 for otherwise unchanged parameters. Alternatively, ideal operations of Alice and Bob (noiseless JPA 3 combined with no losses on Alice’s and Bob’s sides) with a realistic entangled resource would yield a purity of 0.62. Overall, the observed purity is limited by the added noise of the JPAs and the losses in the setup.

   </div> indicates that the remote preparation of a quantum state on Bob’s side is close to perfect security when approaching the optimal point. At the same time, there is a trade-off between the security and range of prepared states. As previously mentioned, a straightforward extension of the optimal working range of RSP can be realized by adding a phase shifter on Alice’s side. Then, all optimally prepared states would fulfill the security criterion 
   <span class="italic">H</span>(
   <span class="italic">M</span>) = 
   <span class="italic">H</span>(
   <span class="italic">M</span>|
   <span class="italic">C</span>) for arbitrary squeezing angles while the accessible squeezing level and purity stay unaffected. It is important to note that a potential eavesdropper cannot obtain any information about 
   <span class="italic">M</span> by listening exclusively to the TMS resource state since the encoding of 
   <span class="italic">M</span> happens later in the protocol. Furthermore, if the eavesdropper completely disentangles the TMS state by its actions, RSP yields no squeezing in the final state which could be exploited to detect the eavesdropper’s presence.
