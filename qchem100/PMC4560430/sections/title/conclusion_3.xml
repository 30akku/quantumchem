 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) The salt bridge interactions between acidic amino acids (Glu
  <span class="sup">-</span> and Asp
  <span class="sup">-</span>) and alkaline amino acids (Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>, Lys
  <span class="sup">+</span> and His
  <span class="sup">+</span>) are the strongest residue-residue interactions. However, this type of interaction may be weakened by solvation effects and broken by lower pH conditions. (2) The cation- interactions between protonated amino acids (Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>, Lys
  <span class="sup">+</span> and His
  <span class="sup">+</span>) and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp and His) are 2.5 to 5-fold stronger than common hydrogen bond interactions and are less affected by the solvation environment. (3) The amide bridge interactions between the two amide-containing amino acids (Asn and Gln) are three times stronger than hydrogen bond interactions, which are less influenced by the pH of the solution. (4) Ten of the twenty natural amino acids are involved in salt bridge, or cation-, or amide bridge interactions that often play important roles in protein-protein, protein-peptide, protein-ligand, and protein-DNA interactions.
