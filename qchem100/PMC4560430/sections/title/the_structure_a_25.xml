 <div class="title">The structure and binding sites of amantadine in p7 ion channel (PDB code: 2M6X) of the hepatitis C virus (HCV).</div>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">A)</span> In the p7 channel, the ligand amantadine is in the six hydrophobic pockets consisting of Leu 52, Val 53, Leu55, and Leu 56 from H3 and Phe 20, Val 25, and Val 26 from H2. The hydrophobic residues are shown in green and Trp-21 is shown in white lines. 
  <span class="bold">B)</span> The cation-π interaction between the NH
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> group of amantadine and the aromatic indole ring of Trp-21. When Leu20 is replaced by Phe20 (yellow color), the ammonium group (NH
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span>) of amantadine may shift its orientation and form a cation-π bond with Phe20. This mayreasonably explain the Leu20Phe mutation that confers drug resistance in some p7 channel subtypes. 
  <span class="bold">C)</span> The molecular orbital (MO) of the cation-π interaction between the NH
  <sub>3</sub>
  <span class="sup">+</span> group and the aromatic indole ring. The cation perpendicularly points to the π-plane.
