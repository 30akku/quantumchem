 <div class="title">The neuraminidase (NA) structure of influenza A virus (PDB code: 1F8B).</div>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">A)</span> The binding pocket for ligands in the neuraminidase (NA) of influenza A virus. The hydrophobic pocket consists of 17 residues (Ala118, Leu119, Asn151, Ser152, Leu156, Pro178, Ser198, Met222, Asp224, Ser246, Val247, Trp276, Tyr292, Ile294, Gln371, Leu406, and Phe425). 
  <span class="bold">B)</span> The docking structure and salt-bridge interactions of 49 drugs (or ligands) in the binding pocket of neuraminidase (1F8B). There is a formal salt-bridge between the carboxyl group (–COO
  <span class="sup">-</span>) of the ligands and the residue Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>-371. The other two arginine residues (Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>-118 and Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>-292) are on either side of the carboxyl group (–COO
  <span class="sup">-</span>), forming two partial salt-bridge bonds with the oxygen atoms of the carboxyl group. The three salt-bridge bonds are indicated by yellow circles.
