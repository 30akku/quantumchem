 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">From this study some useful conclusions are summarized as follows. (1) Ten of the twenty natural amino acids are involved in the three types of strong interactions (salt-bridge, cation-π and amide bridge), which are much stronger than typical hydrogen bonds and often play important roles in protein-protein, protein-peptide, protein-ligand, and protein-DNA interactions. (2) The salt-bridge interactions between acidic (Glu
  <span class="sup">-</span> and Asp
  <span class="sup">-</span>) and basic (Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>, Lys
  <span class="sup">+</span> and His
  <span class="sup">+</span>) amino acids are the strongest residue-residue interactions. However, salt-bridges may be weakened by solvation effects and may be broken by acidic conditions. (3) The cation-π interactions between protonated amino acids (Arg
  <span class="sup">+</span>, Lys
  <span class="sup">+</span>, and His
  <span class="sup">+</span>) and aromatic amino acids (Phe, Tyr, Trp and His) are 2.5 to 5-fold stronger than typical hydrogen bonds and are less affected by solvent and pH than are salt bridge interactions. The cation-π interactions could occur at the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface. (4) Amide bridge interactions are special amino acid interactions that only occur between two amide amino acids (Asn and Gln), and these interactions are three times stronger than typical hydrogen bonds and less affected by pH.
