 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Salt-bridge, cation-π, and amide bridge interactions frequently occur in protein-protein and protein-drug interactions, and often play important roles in these interactions. A solid understanding of these three types of interactions is greatly helpful for the rational design of drugs that target host proteins. Three examples of applications are presented in this section.</p>
