  <p>(
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Schematic representation and (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) scanning electron micrograph (SEM) of an InAs based QPC with two in-plane SGs (G1 and G2). Dark areas are the deep-etched isolation trenches defining the two SGs. The current flows in the x-direction. Application of an asymmetric bias potential between the SGs leads to a lateral electric field along y-direction. The latter is responsible for LSOC in the QPC narrow portion. The 2DEG lies on the xy-plane. The z axis is the direction of growth of the heterostructure.
