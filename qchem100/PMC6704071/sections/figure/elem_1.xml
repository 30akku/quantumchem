   <span class="italic">/h</span>) plots for QPCs 1 through 3. Although the individual pinch-off voltage for each QPC channel is different from one another, the range of common gate signal (V
   <sub>G</sub>) is kept the same for all devices for clarity. All conductance measurements were taken at T = 4.2 K. V
   <sub>G</sub> is the common mode voltage superimposed on initial side gate potentials V
   <sub>G1</sub> and V
   <sub>G2</sub> applied to generate the asymmetric potential energy profile in the narrow portion of the QPC.
