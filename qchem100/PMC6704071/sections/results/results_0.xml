 <p id="Par14" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Focusing on the conductance behavior near the 0.5G
  <sub>0</sub> conductance plateau, it can be seen that the latter is more pronounced for QPC1 with the smallest channel width and gradually disappears as the QPC width increased. For QPC7, the conductance plot is close to linear and there is no remnant of the original conductance plateau as observed for QPC1. The conductance plot for QPC7 is indicative of a near ohmic behavior for the QPC with the largest width. Figures 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a> and 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a> show that the hysteresis loop size in the conductance plots also diminishes as the QPC width increases. QPCs 1 and 2 also have an anomalous conductance plateau around 1.5G
  <sub>0</sub> and QPCs 3 and 4 have another conductance plateau slightly above the normal conductance plateau G
  <sub>0</sub>, typically observed in symmetrically biased QPCs with top split-gates

 <p id="Par15" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Some of the features described above can be explained based on our earlier systematic study of the number and locations of anomalous conductance plateaus in InAs/In
