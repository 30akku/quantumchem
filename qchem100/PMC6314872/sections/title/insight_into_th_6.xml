 <div class="title">Insight into the origin of quantum interference in the reaction product distribution is obtained by a comparison of rigorous quantum scattering calculations with quasi-classical trajectories (for details of the calculations, see the main text and the Supplementary Materials).</div>
 <p>
  <span class="bold">Bottom:</span> Interference fringes are seen in the quantum wave function as it leaves the molecular region, moving toward the asymptotic product channels. 
  <span class="bold">Top and middle:</span> Illustration of how a rotational rainbow effect is predicted as classical trajectories with different phases contribute to the same CO product states labeled by 
  <span class="italic">j</span>’s. Energies in the top panel are relative to the minimum on the ground electronic state. The square of the upper-state wave function provides the weight of the coordinate 
  <span class="italic">R</span> (initially at 
  <span class="italic">R</span>
  <sub>0</sub>). The Jacobi coordinates are used in which 
  <span class="italic">r</span> and 
  <span class="italic">R</span> denote the C-O distance and distance between H and the CO center of mass, while γ is the enclosing angle.
