   <sub>2</sub> invariant can be expanded to classify topological states in magnetic systems if the system possesses a specific magnetic configuration, for instance, an antiferromagnetic state, in which the combined symmetry

While three other crystal terminations (Eu, Sn single and double layer) cannot be excluded in this material without further theoretical and experimental studies, all our data indicate that the (001) crystal surfaces are indeed P-terminated: the calculations for the Eu and Sn terminations show surface states much closer to the center of the BZ. Moreover, our core level spectra (
   <a rid="fig12" ref-type="fig" href="#fig12">Figure 
    <a rid="fig12" ref-type="fig" href="#fig12">12</a>
   </a>) show that the P 2s levels occur at two energies, indicative of two starkly different chemical environments (thus bulk vs surface) for the P atoms. By comparing the band dispersion observed in the ARPES spectra and the DFT calculations, we conclude that the cleaved crystals are some 220 meV hole doped. This is consistent with the large 
   <span class="italic">p</span>-type carrier concentration observed in the Hall measurements.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We note that the calculations show the bottom of six elliptical electron pockets around the M point of the BZ, which are slightly above the chemical potential (about −220 meV compared to the calculated 
   <span class="italic">E</span>
   <sub>F</sub>) observed in the ARPES experiments. This explains why no trace of those calculated bands is seen in ARPES (which sees only filled states) and further gives a hint for why the results of potassium adsorption measurements, expected to electron-dope the surface, resulted in no noticeable band shifts—the flat bottom of an electron pocket is associated with a high density of states, and all the states have to be filled for the shifts in other bands to be observed. We also note that our ARPES measurements at varying incident photon energies show remarkably little difference in the band structure of EuSn
