  <p>ARPES study continued. (A) Two-dimensional momentum maps at several energies near the Fermi level obtained with two photon energies to enhance the visibility of different features in the band structure. The surface band, designated as σ, is clearly observed. (B) Photon energy-dependent map to follow the band dispersion along the 
   <span class="italic">c</span> crystal axis. The plot is at the energy of −200 meV from 
   <span class="italic">E</span>
   <sub>F</sub>. (Vo for the 
   <span class="italic">k</span>
   <sub>
    <span class="italic">z</span>
   </sub> calculation was set to −10 eV). Different bands are marked with different Greek letters.
