 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Three different types of cells (HeLa cells, L02 cells, and macrophage cells) were employed for conducting cell imaging of NM-CQDs. Firstly, the different cells were incubated in 96-well dishes in a humidified incubator under 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> atmosphere for 24 h. Then, 40 µL of the NM-CQDs was introduced to different wells filled with HeLa cells, L02 cells, and macrophage cells, and the wells were further incubated at 37 °C for 3 h. Afterward, the culture medium was removed, and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution (0.01 M, pH = 7.4) three times. Finally, the images of cells stained with NM-CQDs were obtained on a confocal laser scanning microscope. The excitation wavelength of the laser source was 405 nm.
