 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work, N-doped micropore carbon quantum dots with a high quantum yield and dual-wavelength PL emissions were fabricated using pulsed laser ablation (PLA) from low-cost, sustainable, and waste 
  <span class="italic">Platanus</span> biomass. Two strong and coexisting PL emissions in the indigo–blue wavelength region were clearly observed, elucidating that the excited electrons transited from the intrinsic π* orbital to the surface state (SS) formed from the saturation passivation. The QY and FL of the obtained NM-CQDs were as high as 32.4% and 6.56 ns, which exceeded the non-doped CDs and those passivated by other solvents, indicating that the nitrogen-containing functional group was beneficial to improving the quantum yield. Further investigations showed that the emission behaviors of formamide passivated CQDs were still stable and independent in various conditions, such as various excitation wavelengths, salt ionic concentrations, pH values, irradiation times, and temperatures. In addition, the obtained NM-CQDs are very suitable for cellular staining images due to strong and stable PL emission in various conditions and they show good internalization in different cells. Therefore, we propose a new preparation strategy for highly dual-wavelength fluorescent NM-CQDs with great potential in biomedical imaging and engineering.
