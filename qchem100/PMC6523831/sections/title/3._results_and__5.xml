  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a> shows the topography images of NM-CQDs derived from waste 
  <span class="italic">Platanus</span> biomass. Notably, the fruit of 
  <span class="italic">Platanus</span> biomass is yellow in color and in a loose flocculating form (as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>a). The mixture of carbonized 
  <span class="italic">Platanus</span> biomass and KOH was activated to prepare the porous carbon nanomaterial at 900 °C (as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>b). The corresponding TEM image is given in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>c, which indicates that the nanocarbon precursor had an abundantly pored structure after activation. Meanwhile, the N
  <sub>2</sub> sorption isotherm of pored carbon was of a type-I sorption characteristic (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S2a, Supplementary Materials</a>) [
  <a rid="B30-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-nanomaterials-09-00495">30</a>]. Furthermore, the specific surface area was as high as 1690 m
  <span class="sup">2</span>/g. In addition, the pore size distribution ranged from 0.9 nm to 1.8 nm (as shown in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S2b, Supplementary Materials</a>), which was assigned to the microporous structure. These results indicate that the pored carbon precursor is very suitable for preparing high-QY CQDs with great potential in biomedical imaging because more surface defects from the pored structure can induce more electron transition pathways, further facilitating the PL emission [
  <a rid="B31-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B31-nanomaterials-09-00495">31</a>,
  <a rid="B32-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B32-nanomaterials-09-00495">32</a>]. TEM images of the as-prepared NM-CQDs by PLA are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>d,e. Obviously, these NM-CQDs were monodispersed. Statistically, the average size of the as-prepared NM-CQDs by PLA was 8 nm, and most of them were less than 10 nm in size, which is in accordance with the Gaussian fitting (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S3a, Supplementary Materials</a>). The result is also consistent with the dynamic light scattering (DLS) spectrum of NM-CQDs (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S3b, Supplementary Materials</a>). The HR-TEM image of NM-CQDs in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>f reveals a lattice fringe of 0.23 nm, which was ascribed to the (101) plane of layered graphite crystal [
  <a rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-nanomaterials-09-00495">33</a>]. Also, there was a micropore (approximately 1.4 nm) in the center of NM-CQDs. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S4a (Supplementary Materials</a>), the AFM morphology of NM-CQDs indicates that heights of the obtained particles were 1.19, 1.23, and 1.66 nm along the black line. The majority of them were approximately 1.26 nm high (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S5b, Supplementary Materials</a>), which confirms that NM-CQDs possess a structure with a few layers after PLA. Herein, these results show that the NM-CQDs were fabricated from low-cost, sustainable, waste 
  <span class="italic">Platanus</span> biomass by PLA for the first time.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Firstly, we performed XPS measurements to confirm the chemical constituents of the as-prepared NM-CQDs [
  <a rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-nanomaterials-09-00495">34</a>]. XPS analysis revealed that the three distinct strong peaks were mainly C (77%), N (10%), and O (13%) (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S5a, Supplementary Materials</a>), which were located at 285 eV (C
  <sub>1
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> peak), 399 eV (N
  <sub>1
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> peak), and 532 eV (O
  <sub>1
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> peak), respectively. The corresponding high-resolution energy spectrum of the NM-CQDs in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f003" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f003">Figure 3</a>a was assigned to four bands, which were C=O at 288.2 eV, C–O at 287.8 eV, C–N at 285.2 eV, and C–C at 284.6 eV. The binding energy peak located at 284.6 eV revealed the 
  <span class="italic">sp</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> graphitic structures [
  <a rid="B19-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-nanomaterials-09-00495">19</a>], and the peaks of C=O and C–O demonstrated carboxyl or other functional groups on the NM-CQDs. In order to further analyze the structure of the NM-CQDs, the N
  <sub>1
   <span class="italic">s</span>
  </sub> high-resolution XPS was fitted by the Lorentzian method, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S5b (Supplementary Materials)</a>. Clearly, there is an intense band centered at 399.3 eV, which was attributed to the O=C–NH bond [
  <a rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-nanomaterials-09-00495">34</a>,
  <a rid="B35-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-nanomaterials-09-00495">35</a>], indicating that surface passivation groups on the NM-CQDs existed in the form of amides. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f002">Figure 2</a>b, the XRD pattern shows that NM-CQDs had two diffraction peaks. The (002) peak at 2θ = 23.2° was assigned to an amorphous carbon phase [
  <a rid="B28-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-nanomaterials-09-00495">28</a>], and the latter (101) peak at 2θ = 44.3° was attributed to a lattice parameter with the interplanar spacing of 0.23 nm in TEM [
  <a rid="B5-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B5-nanomaterials-09-00495">5</a>]. In addition, Raman spectroscopy, the most convincing fingerprint, was used to analyze the structure and layers of NM-CQDs. The three characteristic Raman peaks are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f003" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f003">Figure 3</a>c, indicating that NM-CQDs still possessed a unique hexagonal layered structure as a PC nanomaterial. The peak located at 1580 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was attributed to the G band, and the other two peaks located at 1338 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 2669 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were attributed to the D band and 2D band, respectively [
  <a rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-nanomaterials-09-00495">36</a>]. Compared with that of bulk porous carbon precursor, the D and G peaks of NM-CQDs were mainly red-shifted by 6 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 9 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively, which was attributed to the change of interlayer interaction of the as-prepared sample after pulsed laser ablation of the PC solution [
  <a rid="B37-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-nanomaterials-09-00495">37</a>]. This phenomenon was similar to the cases of MoS
  <sub>2</sub> and black phosphorus (BP) quantum dots [
  <a rid="B38-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B38-nanomaterials-09-00495">38</a>,
  <a rid="B39-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B39-nanomaterials-09-00495">39</a>]. Furthermore, the relative intensity of the “defect” D peak to the crystalline G peak was 1.02, which was higher than that of bulk PC (0.599), indicating that NM-CQDs had more defects than bulk PC. In addition, presence of the 2D peak of NM-CQDs indicates that the obtained samples possessed a structure with a few layers [
  <a rid="B36-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-nanomaterials-09-00495">36</a>]. Finally, the surface structure of NM-CQDs was further confirmed by FTIR (see 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f003" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f003">Figure 3</a>d). The strong peak at 1658 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> could be attributed to overlapped C=O and N–H bonds. The broad band located from 3556 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> to 3174 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> was attributed to the stretching vibrations of O–H bonds or N–H bonds. The stretching vibrations of C–H bonds were found at 2982 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, 2874 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and 1398 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>. The peaks at 1308 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> and 1054 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> could be attributed to the stretching vibrations of COO
  <span class="sup">−</span> bonds (zeta potential ~13.5 mV in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S6, Supplementary Materials</a>) and C–O bonds, respectively [
  <a rid="B34-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B34-nanomaterials-09-00495">34</a>,
  <a rid="B40-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B40-nanomaterials-09-00495">40</a>,
  <a rid="B41-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B41-nanomaterials-09-00495">41</a>]. The presence of C=O and N–H bonds, as surface passivation groups, indicated that carboxyl or amino moieties existed on the NM-CQDs, in accordance with the XPS measurement. During the PLA process of fabricating NM-CQDs in formamide, bulk porous carbon powder rapidly absorbed the localized high energy within a micro area, and was cracked into porous 
  <span class="italic">sp</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> nanoclusters with a few layers, i.e., the skeleton of NM-CQDs. Meanwhile, formamide solvent molecules were also pyrolyzed by a laser with sufficient energy to form oxygen-containing and nitrogen-containing groups (e.g., carboxyl and amino moieties, etc.). The cracked functional groups rapidly passivated C atoms on the surface and edges of 
  <span class="italic">sp</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> nanoclusters with a few layers to form the electron-donating substituents of NM-CQDs. Finally, the CQDs that consisted of porous 
  <span class="italic">sp</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> nanosized domains with a few layers and electron-donating substituents on the periphery and surfaces were obtained. These electron-donating functional groups are very important to obtain intense, stable, and excitation-independent PL emission.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Evidently, the supernatant of NM-CQDs was yellow in color under room-light irradiation, while indigo–blue emission could be observed under UV-lamp (λ = 365 nm) irradiation in the inset of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f004" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f004">Figure 4</a>a. Two absorption bands centered at 295 nm and 389 nm can be clearly observed in the UV–Vis spectrum. Interestingly, two coexisting distinct emission bands centered at 447 nm and 476 nm could also be seen in the PL emission spectrum. The PL emission peak centered at 476 nm was much stronger than that of the peak centered at 447 nm, displaying the indigo–blue emission. Unlike most of the reported CQDs [
  <a rid="B42-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B42-nanomaterials-09-00495">42</a>,
  <a rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-nanomaterials-09-00495">43</a>,
  <a rid="B44-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B44-nanomaterials-09-00495">44</a>], PL emission bands of NM-CQDs synthesized in formamide by PLA remained unshifted with the excitation wavelengths changing. The centers of the two bands were always situated at 447 nm and 476 nm in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f004" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f004">Figure 4</a>b, whereas the PL intensities of the NM-CQDs increased first and then decreased as the excitation wavelengths changed from 340 to 400 nm. The PL intensity was maximum when NM-CQDs were excited with a wavelength of 390 nm. It can be noted that the intense and stable PL emissions were not derived from formamide molecules. This phenomenon can be certified by comparing the PL emission intensities of formamide (dotted line) to those of NM-CQDs (solid line) in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S7 (Supplementary Materials)</a>. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f004" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f004">Figure 4</a>c shows the PL emissions of NM-CQDs with an excitation wavelength of 390 nm from the first to the ninth day. The PL emission intensities of the NM-CQDs were enhanced as time was prolonged because the agglomeration of particles made the non-radiative transitions of excited electrons reduce with prolonged time [
  <a rid="B45-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B45-nanomaterials-09-00495">45</a>,
  <a rid="B46-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-nanomaterials-09-00495">46</a>]. The intensities tended to be stable with the high quantum yield of 32.4% until the ninth day (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S8, Supplementary Materials</a>). According to previous reports [
  <a rid="B33-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B33-nanomaterials-09-00495">33</a>,
  <a rid="B47-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B47-nanomaterials-09-00495">47</a>,
  <a rid="B48-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B48-nanomaterials-09-00495">48</a>,
  <a rid="B49-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B49-nanomaterials-09-00495">49</a>], species, such as amine moieties, are crucial to improving PL properties of CQDs. Here, apart from formamide, ethyl acetate (EA) and ethylene glycol (EG) were also employed to investigate whether passivation with different solvents would impact the quantum yields of the CQDs by means of PLA. Obviously, TEM and HR-TEM images showed that NM-CQDs synthesized in different solvents were still monodispersed and possessed a distinct lattice and a micropore (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S9, Supplementary Materials</a>). Unlike NM-CQDs synthesized in formamide, non-doped CQDs, i.e., M-CQDs-EA and M-CQDs-EG, lacked N elements (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S11a,b, Supplementary Materials</a>). Compared with M-CQDs-EG, M-CQDs-EA had more C=O groups (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S10c,d, Supplementary Materials</a>). Furthermore, the quantum yields of M-CQDs-EA and M-CQDs-EG were only 15.5% and 6.3%, respectively, indicating that the nitrogen-containing groups were beneficial for increasing the QY of CQDs. As a comparation, N-CQDs from non-microporous carbon precursors were also synthesized in formamide solvent to investigate the effect of microporous structure on PL emission. TEM and HR-TEM images showed N-CQDs were absent of a microporous structure (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S11a,b, Supplementary Materials</a>). Compared with NM-CQDs, N-CQDs had fewer defects (
  <span class="italic">I
   <sub>D</sub>/I
   <sub>G</sub>
  </span> = 0.87) and showed a relatively weaker PL emission (see 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S11c,d, Supplementary Materials</a>), which indicated that the introduction of microporous structure can further improve the quantum yield of CQDs. Furthermore, fluorescence intensities of NM-CQDs were stable under high salt ionic concentrations (up to 400 mM NaCl) and a wide range of pH values (pH 4–9) (as shown in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S12a,b, Supplementary Materials</a>). PL intensities of NM-CQDs were almost unchanged with the same excitation wavelength after 1800 s (as shown in 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S12c, Supplementary Materials</a>), indicating that the indigo–blue emission of NM-CQDs prepared by PLA was stable for a moment. In addition, 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00495" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00495">Figure S12d (Supplementary Materials)</a> shows that the PL intensity also decreased slightly when temperature changed from 293.15 K to 393.15 K, which indicated that the strong, stable, and excitation-independent indigo–blue PL emission of NM-CQDs originated from the surface states [
  <a rid="B43-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B43-nanomaterials-09-00495">43</a>]. Finally, the PL lifetime of NM-CQDs was also detected using a fluorescence spectrometer. The differently colored discrete dots in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f004" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f004">Figure 4</a>d display the PL decay profiles of the NM-CQDs by monitoring PL peaks at 447 nm (violet squares) and 476 nm (blue circles) with an excitation wavelength at 375 nm using a time-correlated single photon counting method. The corresponding instrument response curve is also given in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f004" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f004">Figure 4</a>d. The lifetime data of NM-CQDs were fitted with the triplet-exponential function shown below.

  <a rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-t001" ref-type="table" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-t001">Table 1</a>). Therefore, the observed lifetimes of NM-CQDs over a nanosecond suggest that the as-synthesized sample can be a desirable candidate for biological applications [

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In previous studies, some impurities were possibly produced using the acid treatment method or hydrothermal method in colloidal CQDs due to severe conditions (e.g., strong acid). Hence, the PL mechanism of CQDs remained ambiguous and is still an open issue to be discussed by researchers. In general, the PL emission of CQDs is probably derived from electron transitions of the intrinsic state [

  <a rid="B56-nanomaterials-09-00495" ref-type="bibr" href="#B56-nanomaterials-09-00495">56</a>]. To clearly clarify the PL mechanism of the NM-CQDs, the photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectrum was measured by monitoring the PL emission band centered at 470 nm; then, it was fitted into two primary components (green curves) located at 377 nm (~3.29 eV) and 397 nm (~3.12 eV) by a Lorentzian function, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f005" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f005">Figure 5</a>a. The PLE spectrum including the dual-excitation band provides imperative theoretical evidence for further proposing a reasonable PL mechanism of NM-CQDs. In the PLA process, the local high temperature pyrolyzes the bulk PC precursor into 
  <span class="italic">sp</span>
  <span class="sup">2</span> nanoclusters (π and π* orbitals) which have many dangling bonds on the periphery, surface, and pored positions. Meanwhile, formamide solvent molecules are simultaneously pyrolyzed into nitrogen-containing and oxygen-containing functional groups which can directly passivate the edges and surfaces of PC nanoclusters to form passivation layer structures. Therefore, surface molecular orbitals (surface state) from the cracked formamide are generated between the π and π* states. In general, the surface state has a strong ability to capture electrons. The excited electrons will recombine with holes on the surface state to generate the intense and stable PL emission after vibrational relaxation. Thus, the broad absorption band centered at 389 nm is probably derived from the electron contribution of the surface state in the UV–Vis absorption spectrum. By further calculating PLE and PL spectra, the energy difference of fitting excitation peaks centered at 377 nm (~3.29 eV) and 397 nm (~3.12 eV) was approximately 0.17 eV, which was nearly equal to that of the PL emission peaks centered at 447 nm (~2.77 eV) and 476 nm (~2.60 eV) in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00495-f005" href="#nanomaterials-09-00495-f005">Figure 5</a>b. Thus, the intense and double coexisting PL emissions were attributed to electron transitions from the π* orbital to the surface molecular orbitals (S
  <sub>1</sub> and S
  <sub>2</sub>), which were possibly related to nitrogen-containing or oxygen-containing functional groups. These functional groups are also called fluorescent chromophores, which can donate their electrons to the nanoscale microporous C domains for increasing the charge density of the core. Hence, the energy levels of NM-CQDs rose and the band gap narrowed, similar to the case of increasing the size of the CQDs to reduce the band gap. With the number of functional groups increasing, the passivation could be saturated. The band gap of NM-CQDs was invariant and insensitive to the size owing to the saturated passivation. The electron-donating functional groups played a leading role in controlling the PL emission of the NM-CQDs in wavelength and intensity. Eventually, two coexisting, intense, stable, and excitation-independent indigo–blue PL emissions of NM-CQDs could be clearly observed.
