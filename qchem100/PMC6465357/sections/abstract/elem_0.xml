 <p id="Par1">Auger recombination is the main non-radiative decay pathway for multi-carrier states of colloidal quantum dots, which affects performance of most of their optical and optoelectronic applications. Outstanding single-exciton properties of CdSe/CdS core/shell quantum dots enable us to simultaneously study the two basic types of Auger recombination channels—negative trion and positive trion channels. Though Auger rates of positive trion are regarded to be much faster than that of negative trion for II-VI quantum dots in literature, our experiments find the two rates can be inverted for certain core/shell geometries. This is confirmed by theoretical calculations as a result of geometry-dependent dielectric screening. By varying the core/shell geometry, both types of Auger rates can be independently tuned for ~ 1 order of magnitude. Experimental and theoretical findings shed new light on designing quantum dots with necessary Auger recombination characteristics for high-power light-emitting-diodes, lasers, single-molecular tracking, super-resolution microscope, and advanced quantum light sources.</p>
