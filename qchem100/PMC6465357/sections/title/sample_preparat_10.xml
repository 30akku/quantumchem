  </span>. For conventional ensemble optical measurements, QD samples were diluted in toluene until the optical density was around 0.1 at the first-exciton absorption peak. QD micro-liquid films were fabricated by transferring a droplet of QD solution (~ 10 µL) to a clean cover slip and mounting another cover slip on the top. The thickness of QD liquid film between two cover slips was around 10 µm determined by imaging the uppermost and lowermost emitting QDs in the liquid film using a fluorescence microscope (see details below). For single-dot spectroscopy experiments, diluted QD solution in toluene with 2.5% PMMA by weight was spin-casted on a clean cover slip. All optical measurements were performed at room temperature.
