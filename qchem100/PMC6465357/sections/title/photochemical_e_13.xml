 <p id="Par45" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Lithium triethylborohydride (Li(Et
  <sub>3</sub>BH), 20 μL of 1 mol/L) in tetrahydrofuran (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to 1 mL of anhydrous toluene to form photochemical electron-doping solution. The solution of CdSe/CdS core/shell QDs (optical density of band-edge absorption peak &lt; 0.1) in anhydrous toluene and 10 μL of trioctylphosphine was loaded into an air-tight cuvette. Into the QD solution in the cuvette, the Li(Et
  <sub>3</sub>BH) solution was added stepwise with 50−1000 equivalent of CdSe/CdS QDs. The resulting solutions were exposed to a 365 nm LED (∼ 6 mW) for photochemical electron-doping. After a few minutes of photo-radiation, the QD sample reached a steady-state, indicated by stable absorption and photoluminescence spectra.

 <p id="Par46" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All above operations were performed at room temperature and under N
  <sub>2</sub> atmosphere in a glove box. By varying the amount of Li(Et
  <sub>3</sub>BH) added, the portion of negatively charged QDs in a solution was controlled.
