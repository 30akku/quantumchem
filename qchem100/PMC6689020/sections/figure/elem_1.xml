   <span class="bold">c</span> Normalized device EL, current density and EQE under cyclic voltages between −1 and 2.5 V after aging test. The EL/current density/EQE show recovery. 
   <span class="bold">d</span> Microscopy image and corresponding PL and EL intensity maps of device without BA treatment (scale bar, 70 μm), which show the degradation starts from the edge of Au electrode and the EL degrades faster than the PL. 
   <span class="bold">e</span> Microscopy image and corresponding PL and EL intensity maps of device with BA treatment (scale bar, 70 μm), which show that the BA interfacial layer significantly suppresses the device degradation
