   <span class="bold">c</span> Normalized IPCE at the absorption onset for a device fabricated with 10 wt.% FAPbI
   <sub>3</sub> film, measured by using FTPS. An

   <span class="bold">d</span> Excitation-intensity-dependent PLQE of FAPbI
   <sub>3</sub> films fabricated from precursor solutions with different concentrations. The maximum PLQEs for 20 wt.%, 15 wt.%, 10 wt.%, 7 wt.%, 5 wt.% and BA treated 10 wt.% perovskite films are 29, 42, 60, 46, 30, and 68%, respectively
