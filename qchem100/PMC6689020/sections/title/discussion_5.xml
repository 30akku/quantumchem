 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We demonstrated that solution-processed PeLEDs can achieve good stability, and higher energy conversion efficiency than organic LEDs and quantum-dot LEDs. More importantly, the PeLEDs showed negligible EQE droop at high current density up to 300 mA cm
  <span class="sup">−2</span>. This fact is very different with organic LEDs and quantum-dot LEDs, with which EQE droops at around 10 mA cm
  <span class="sup">−2</span> when exciton induced quenching effect occurs
