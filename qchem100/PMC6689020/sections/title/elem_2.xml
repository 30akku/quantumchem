  </p>
  <p id="Par6" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We highlight that our PeLEDs with high ECEs show remarkable operation stability. A device with simple glass-epoxy encapsulation method, exhibits a lifetime (

   <span class="sup">−2</span>)
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6" href="#CR6">6</a>
   </span>. We believe that the significantly improved stability is due to the high ECE, since low efficiency FAPbI
   <sub>3</sub> PeLED devices (with 20 wt.% of precursor solution) can only have similar lifetime to previous results. We have measured the stability of FAPbI
   <sub>3</sub> LEDs under 25, 35, and 45 °C in a glovebox. The result shows that the stability is strongly dependent on the temperature (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>), indicating the high ECE can effectively improve the stability due to less thermal energy generated. We find the device stability can be further enhanced by benzylamine (BA) treatment which was previously demonstrated to be effective as a moisture-resistance and defect-passivation to suppress ion migration in perovskite solar cells

  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The degraded EL can be caused by the degradation of either emission properties of the perovskites or the electrical transport properties of the devices. In order to reveal more detail on the aging process, we simultaneously measure the PL and EL by using chopped laser light and lock-in amplifier
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21" href="#CR21">21</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22" href="#CR22">22</a>
   </span>. During the measurement, the device is under a constant current density of 100 mA cm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>, and the excitation light intensity (425 nm CW laser) was kept extremely low to avoid disturbing EL, around 0.2 mW cm
   <span class="sup">−2</span>. The in situ PL/EL measurements show that the PL decline is slower than the EL decline (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). When the EL decreased to half of its initial value, the PL intensity was 67% of its initial value. We hypothesis that in addition to the degradation of the emission layer, the EL degradation is partially due to the deterioration of interfacial (or charge balance) properties of the devices, since the EL degradation is more seriously than the PL degradation. In order to verify this hypothesis, we measured EL and current density of an aged device under cyclic voltages between −1 and 2.5 V (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a>). The results show that the EL and current density can be recovered. After eight cycles, the EL intensity almost doubles and the EQE is recovered by a factor of 1.23 at the bias voltage of 2.5 V (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>). These results are consistent with the scenario that the interface is deteriorated during the aging process by formation of interfacial barrier, and the barrier can be reduced by using cyclic voltages
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23" href="#CR23">23</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24" href="#CR24">24</a>
   </span>. The formation of bias-dependent interfacial barrier is likely associated with the ion migration in perovskites
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25" href="#CR25">25</a>
   </span>. The observed recoverable EL performance is important for long-term application of PeLEDs.
  </p>
  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to obtain more insights on the degradation process of our PeLEDs, we used a confocal fluorescence microscope to measure the PL and EL mapping of the devices in air (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a>). The PL and EL mapping measurements both show that the dark areas enlarge from the edge of metal electrode, indicating that degradation of devices starts from the edge, which is likely due to the fast penetration of moisture from the metal-uncovered part. Interestingly, the mapping measurement also shows that the EL dark area enlarges much more quickly than the PL dark area. In particular, for LED without BA treatment, there is almost no EL mapping signal after biasing for 12 min, while the PL intensity is still relatively high. This fact suggests the interfacial degradation plays important role in the aging process of PeLEDs, which is consistent with the above in situ PL/EL intensity measurement. Importantly, the BA treated device shows reduced degradation rate from the edge, and the EL and PL intensity in the center of device exhibits comparable rate of decrease. Since the BA treatment mainly improves the perovskite layer surface, we believe that the improved lifetime of device is mainly due to the reduced interfacial defects and enhanced moisture resistance of the perovskite film after BA treatment.

  <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition to the 10 wt.% device, we also fabricated LEDs using perovskite films processed from precursor solutions with varied concentrations. Detailed device characterization results are presented in Supplementary Fig.

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The high-quality perovskite film processed from the 10 wt.% precursor solution is critical to achieve the exceptional LED performance. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) characterizations show full coverage of this film (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>), suggesting that leakage current due to direct contacting of ETLs and HTLs can be minimal. As shown in the Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, the film coverage becomes poor and discontinuous when the lower concentration solution is used. This leads to reduced EL efficiency due to the more morphological defects which can result in greater leakage current
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2" href="#CR2">2</a>
   </span>. In addition, the PL lifetime of the films with lower concentration are 21 ns for 7 wt.% film and 17 ns for 5 wt.% film under a fluence of 4 nJ cm
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The short PL lifetime can be attributed to the high defects presented in these poor perovskite films. In case of the higher concentration precursor solution than 10 wt.%, the perovskite film shows good coverage. However, we find that the optical properties of these perovskite films are much inferior to those of 10 wt.% film. Transient PL decay measurement shows that the PL lifetime of the 10 wt.% perovskite film is around 1 μs under a fluence of 4 nJ cm
   <span class="sup">−2</span> (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), indicating very low defect density. The PL lifetime is 68 and 59 ns for 15 wt.% and 20 wt.% films under the same fluence, respectively (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>), indicating high trap densities presented in these high concentration films. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a> also shows that PL lifetimes at various emission wavelengths are almost identical in the 10 wt.% perovskite film, which suggests that the PL spectrum is homogenously broadened in the perovskite film
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26" href="#CR26">26</a>

The 10 wt.% perovskite has the largest crystal size. And the higher concentration perovskite films show smaller crystallites dispersed in the grains, consistent with the higher level of disorder presented. The different crystal sizes inside the grains are also consistent with the different extent of blue-shifted PL/EL emission peaks of the perovskite films (Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6d</a> and Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">12b</a>). We think that the most blue-shifted PL/EL emission peak of the 20 wt.% films are likely due to the quantum-confinement effect of the small crystallites
