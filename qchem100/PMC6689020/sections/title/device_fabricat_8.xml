  </span>. Here the perovskite films were prepared by spin-coating the precursor solution onto the PEIE treated ZnO films, followed by annealing on a hot plate at 100 °C. During the spin-coating of perovskite film, 100 μl of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the film after delay time of 5 s from the start of spinning

  </span>. For PeLEDs with BA treatment, 30 μl of BA dissolved in chlorobenzene (1 vol.%) was spin-coated onto the annealed perovskite film. Then the BA treated perovskite film was annealed at 100 °C for 5 min to remove chlorobenzene.
