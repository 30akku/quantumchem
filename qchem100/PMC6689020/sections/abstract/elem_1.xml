 <p id="Par2">Light-emitting diodes based on halide perovskites have made remarkable progress but their stability is the bottleneck. Here Miao 
  <span class="italic">et al</span>. show 14% quantum efficiency at a current density of 300 mA cm-2 and 23.7â€‰hr lifetime under a current density of 100 mA cm-2, making it promising for actual application.
