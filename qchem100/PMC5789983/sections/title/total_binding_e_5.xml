 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To evaluate the binding interaction energies through fragment-based quantum mechanics method, it is important to take into account every significant attractive and repulsive amino-acid residue which can influence this mechanism. Therefore, instead of taking an arbitrary region of the binding site, we performed a search for an optimal binding pocket radius (
  <span class="italic">r</span>) in which a variation less than 10% of the sequential pocket radius could be observed after a radius increase. For this task, the binding pocket radius 
  <span class="italic">r</span> is varied from 2.0 Å (−32.04 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> = 20 and −27.29 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> = 40) to 8.0 Å (−187.17 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> = 20 and −186.08 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> = 40) in order to determine the best value of 
  <span class="italic">r</span>, found to be 6.0 Å corresponding to an energy of −179.94 (−179.60) kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span> for 
  <span class="italic">ε</span> = 20 (40), from which the convergence was achieved (see Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig9" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig9">9</a>). This result is in agreement with previous works, stating that after 6.0-7.0 Å the molecular interactions are weak
