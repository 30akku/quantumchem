 <p id="Par1">Much of the recent excitement in the cancer immunotherapy approach has been generated by the recognition that immune checkpoint proteins, like the receptor PD-1, can be blocked by antibody-based drugs with profound effects. Promising clinical data have already been released pointing to the efficiency of the drug pembrolizumab to block the PD-1 pathway, triggering the T-lymphocytes to destroy the cancer cells. Thus, a deep understanding of this drug/receptor complex is essential for the improvement of new drugs targeting the protein PD-1. In this context, by employing quantum chemistry methods based on the Density Functional Theory (DFT), we investigate in silico the binding energy features of the receptor PD-1 in complex with its drug inhibitor. Our computational results give a better understanding of the binding mechanisms, being also an efficient alternative towards the development of antibody-based drugs, pointing to new treatments for cancer therapy.</p>
