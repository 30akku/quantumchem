 <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The dynamics was analysed as follows: through the interaction of the molecular ensemble with the alignment-laser pulses, a coherent wavepacket was created from each of the initially populated rotational states. These wavepackets were expressed as a coherent superposition of eigenfunctions of the field-free rotational Hamiltonian, that is

  </div>, the quantum number of angular momentum 
  <span class="italic">J</span>, and its projection 
  <span class="italic">M</span> onto the laboratory-fixed axis defined by the laser polarisation. We note that 
  <span class="italic">M</span> was conserved and thus no 
  <span class="italic">ϕ</span> dependence existed. The angular distribution is defined as the sum of the squared moduli of all Ψ(

  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a>, we observed the same degree of alignment for angular distributions that are in fact very different from each other. This highlights that much more information is contained in the angular distributions than in the commonly utilised expectation value

 <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the probe laser is polarised perpendicularly to the detector plane, the cylindrical symmetry as generated by the alignment-laser polarisation was broken and an Abel inversion to retrieve the 3D angular distribution directly from the experimental VMI images was not possible. In order to retrieve the complete 3D wavepacket, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) was solved for a rigid rotor coupled to a non-resonant ac electric field representing the two-laser pulses as well as the dc electric field of the VMI spectrometer. For a direct comparison with the experimental data the rotational wavepacket and thus the 3D angular distribution was constructed and, using a Monte-Carlo approach, projected onto a 2D screen using the radial distribution extracted from the experiment at the alignment revival at 120.78 ps. The relation between the 3D rotational wavepacket and the 2D projected density is graphically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. The anisotropic angle-dependent ionisation efficiency for double ionisation, resulting in a two-body breakup into O
  <span class="sup">+</span> and CS
  <span class="sup">+</span> fragments, was taken into account by approximating it by the square of the measured single-electron ionisation rate. Non-axial recoil during the fragmentation process is expected to be negligible and was not included in the simulations.
