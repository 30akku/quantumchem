 <p id="Par3" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The filming of nuclear motion during molecular dynamics at relevant timescales, dubbed the “molecular movie”, has been a longstanding dream in the molecular sciences

 <p id="Par4" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Rotational quantum dynamics of isolated molecules provides an interesting and important testbed that provides and requires direct access to angular coordinates. Furthermore, different from most molecular processes, it can be practically exactly described by current numerical methods, even for complex molecules. Rotational wavepackets were produced through the interaction of the molecule with short laser pulses

 <p id="Par5" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Here, we demonstrate the direct experimental high-resolution imaging of the time-dependent angular probability-density distribution of a rotational wavepacket and its complete characterisation in terms of the populations and phases of field-free rotor states. Utilising a state-selected molecular sample and an optimised two-laser-pulse sequence, see Supplementary Note 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>, a broad phase-locked rotational wavepacket was created. Using mid-infra-red-laser strong-field ionisation and Coulomb-explosion ion imaging, an unprecedented degree of field-free alignment of 〈cos

  <sub>2D</sub>〉 = 0.96, or 〈cos
  <span class="sup">2</span>
  <span class="italic">θ</span>〉 = 0.94, was obtained at the full revivals, whereas in between a rich angular dynamics was observed with very high resolution, from which the complete wavepacket could be uniquely derived. While the dynamics has low dimensionality, the resulting—purely experimentally obtained—movie provides a most direct realisation of the envisioned molecular movie. We point out that the data also is a measurement of a complete quantum carpet
