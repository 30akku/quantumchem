  </span>, with &gt;80% purity, as a showcase. Two off-resonant near-IR pump pulses of 800 nm central wavelength, separated by 38.1(1) ps and with a pulse duration of 250 fs, that is much shorter than the rotational period of OCS of 82.2 ps, were used to create the rotational wavepacket. These pulses were linearly polarised parallel to the detector plane. The probe pulse with a central wavelength of 1.75 μm was polarised perpendicularly to the detector plane to minimise the effects of geometric alignment and ensures that the observed degree of alignment was a lower boundary of the real value. The probe pulse multiply ionised the molecules, resulting in Coulomb explosion into ionic fragments. Two-dimensional (2D) ion-momentum distributions of O
