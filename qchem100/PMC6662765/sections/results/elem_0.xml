Two off-resonant near-IR pump pulses of 800 nm central wavelength, separated by 38.1(1) ps and with a pulse duration of 250 fs, that is much shorter than the rotational period of OCS of 82.2 ps, were used to create the rotational wavepacket. These pulses were linearly polarised parallel to the detector plane. The probe pulse with a central wavelength of 1.75 μm was polarised perpendicularly to the detector plane to minimise the effects of geometric alignment and ensures that the observed degree of alignment was a lower boundary of the real value. The probe pulse multiply ionised the molecules, resulting in Coulomb explosion into ionic fragments. Two-dimensional (2D) ion-momentum distributions of O
   <span class="sup">+</span> fragments, which reflect the orientation of the molecules in space at the instance of ionisation, were recorded by a velocity map imaging (VMI) spectrometer

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As the probe laser is polarised perpendicularly to the detector plane, the cylindrical symmetry as generated by the alignment-laser polarisation was broken and an Abel inversion to retrieve the 3D angular distribution directly from the experimental VMI images was not possible. In order to retrieve the complete 3D wavepacket, the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) was solved for a rigid rotor coupled to a non-resonant ac electric field representing the two-laser pulses as well as the dc electric field of the VMI spectrometer. For a direct comparison with the experimental data the rotational wavepacket and thus the 3D angular distribution was constructed and, using a Monte-Carlo approach, projected onto a 2D screen using the radial distribution extracted from the experiment at the alignment revival at 120.78 ps. The relation between the 3D rotational wavepacket and the 2D projected density is graphically illustrated in Supplementary Fig. 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. The anisotropic angle-dependent ionisation efficiency for double ionisation, resulting in a two-body breakup into O
   <span class="sup">+</span> and CS
   <span class="sup">+</span> fragments, was taken into account by approximating it by the square of the measured single-electron ionisation rate. Non-axial recoil during the fragmentation process is expected to be negligible and was not included in the simulations.

  <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The initial-state distribution in the quantum-state selected OCS sample as well as the interaction volume with the alignment and probe lasers were not known a priori and used as fitting parameters. For each set of parameters the TDSE was solved and the 2D projection of the rotational density, averaged over the initial-state distribution and the interaction volume of the pump and probe lasers, was carried out. The aforementioned expansion in terms of Legendre polynomials was realised for the experimental and simulated angular distributions and the best fit was determined through least squares minimisation, see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. Taking into account the eight lowest even moments of the angular distribution allowed to precisely reproduce the experimental angular distribution. The results for the first four moments are shown in Fig.
