   <span class="italic">x</span>, 
   <span class="italic">y</span> and

   <span class="italic">θ</span> defines the angle between the −
   <span class="italic">z</span> axis and the applied magnetic field. The polarisation axes of the pump and probe beams are parallel and are indicated in the figure.

   <span class="italic">xz</span> plane. The data shown in all panels were averaged over a time window from 0.07 to 0.09 μs after laser excitation. The grey bars in panels 
   <span class="bold">c</span>–
   <span class="bold">e</span> indicate the (average) standard deviation of the mean. The black solid lines represent best sinusoidal fits to the data
