  </span>. The MFE experiments detected by TA were performed at 120 K in MTHF. The solvent was purchased inhibitor free (Sigma-Aldrich, anhydrous, ≥99%) and kept under argon atmosphere. Any formed peroxides and traces of water were removed by passing the solvent over a column of activated alumina prior to use. A solution of 
  <span class="bold">CPF</span> in MTHF was prepared at an optical density of about 0.4 at the excitation wavelength (3 mm optical path) and transferred into a custom-made rectangular optical cell with an optical path length of about 3 mm. Oxygen was removed by several freeze–thaw cycles and the cell was subsequently flame sealed under vacuum.
