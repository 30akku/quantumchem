 <p id="Par35" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The present study provides the first unequivocal experimental proof of a radical pair-driven compass operational at magnetic field strengths relevant to avian magnetoreception. The orientation dependence of the hyperfine-driven MFE response is demonstrated in the low-field region at fields comparable to that of the Earth on two model triad systems and for two different field strengths. The robustness of the calibration of the small fields in both magnitude and direction is ascertained by test experiments.</p>
 <p id="Par36" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Having demonstrated the feasibility of a chemical compass response at such weak fields in a model system, the uncertainty regarding the existence of such anisotropic effects in a natural magnetosensor in ambient field conditions remains. The most likely avian magnetosensor is arguably the flavin/tryptophan radical pair generated by blue light excitation in the protein cryptochrome

  </span>. Yet field effects in vitro, in the isolated, intact proteins, have been only observed in isotropic solutions and at fields exceeding that of the Earth by a factor of approximately 20, with only one study providing experimental proof for a low-field feature

  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53" href="#CR53">53</a>
  </span>, albeit remarkable, poses significant questions, such as a surprisingly short lifetime of the radical pair and small distance (large exchange interaction) between the radical partners, both directly at odds with the requirements for a (low) field-sensitive radical pair

 <p id="Par37" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The model triads studied here most certainly derive their exceptional compass sensitivity from a number of beneficial properties, namely: (1) Spin relaxation and radical pair kinetics that are slow enough to allow for efficient spin evolution, (2) strong axiality of the dominant hyperfine coupling(s) in one of the radical pair partners (here 
  <span class="bold">C</span>
  <span class="sup">•+</span>), and (3) absence of any significant hyperfine couplings in the other (here 
  <span class="bold">F</span>
  <span class="sup">•−</span>). Clearly, these properties and our results presented here can serve as useful guidelines for designing and analysing other highly sensitive artificial chemical compass systems.
 </p>
 <p id="Par38" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the context of animal magnetoreception, one can well imagine that relaxation and recombination rates for the cryptochrome radical pair might have been optimised for function by evolution, e.g., through interaction with binding partners, slight variations of protein structure as well as solution accessibility (protonation/deprotonation) of the radicals (especially the terminal tryptophan)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55" href="#CR55">55</a>
  </span>. The second condition of strong axiality of the hyperfine couplings is, at least to some degree, fulfilled by the flavin radical
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56" href="#CR56">56</a>
  </span>. However, a hyperfine-coupling-free second radical is harder to imagine. The frequently evoked hypothesis of the involvement of a superoxide radical,

 <p id="Par39" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">One further hypothesis regards the involvement of the ascorbyl radical characterised by few and small isotropic hyperfine couplings
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58" href="#CR58">58</a>
  </span>. In solution, the flavin/ascorbyl pair demonstrated sensitivity to weak fields much exceeding previously reported effects in other flavin-containing radical pairs, including cryptochromes. However, recent molecular dynamics simulations suggest that the brief and infrequent encounters of the ascorbyl radical with cryptochrome make this also an unlikely candidate in the search for an Earth strength field sensor

 <p id="Par40" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We are hence at crossroads: experimentally we have proven (i) the sensitivity of light-induced radical pairs in cryptochromes to applied magnetic fields

  </span>, if an order of magnitude larger than that of the Earth, and (ii) with this study, we have demonstrated, for the first time, the feasibility of a radical pair compass functional in fields relevant to magnetoreception, if in a model system. Any further studies in the discussion of a radical pair-based magnetoreceptor in cryptochrome need to be aimed towards high sensitivity measurements of such weak-field compass responses in oriented or otherwise immobilised proteins. Importantly, such techniques need to provide information on the identity of the radical pair partners involved and will most likely demand the application of optical or magnetic resonance techniques, which allow the identification of the involved radicals via their spectral fingerprints. These studies might well not be successful on the isolated proteins in vitro but demand the investigation of these systems in cellular environments where binding partners and solution conditions match those found in vivo.
