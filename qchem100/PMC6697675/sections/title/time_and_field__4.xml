  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a> demonstrates that a 100 μT field confers a pronounced effect on the recombination kinetics of the radical pair. In the presence of the magnetic field, the concentration of radicals immediately following the laser pulse is enhanced, ΔΔ
  <span class="italic">A</span>(
  <span class="italic">t</span> &lt; 220 ns, 100 μT) &gt; 0, but fewer radicals survive to microsecond timescales, ΔΔ

  <span class="italic">t</span> &gt; 220 ns, 100 μT) &lt; 0. This biphasic behaviour has been noted before and seems to be characteristic of singlet-born radical pairs with

 <p id="Par24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The percentage field effects MFE(
  <span class="italic">t</span>, 
  <span class="italic">B</span>
  <sub>0</sub>), obtained at different times 
  <span class="italic">t</span> after laser excitation, are shown in Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1d</a>. Our initial discussion will concentrate on the data obtained at early and late times, i.e., 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0.08 μs and 
  <span class="italic">t</span> = 0.71 μs. Both MFE traces follow the expected behaviour, with application of both low and high fields effecting changes in radical concentration of opposite sign. Following the discussion in reference
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span>, weak magnetic fields mainly enhance the 
  <span class="italic">S</span>–
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>0</sub> interconversion efficiency, which results in an increase in radical concentration at early times after laser excitation (the initially predominantly singlet population is driven more effectively into less reactive triplet) and in a decrease in radical concentration at late times (when formed triplet radical pairs can return more efficiently to singlet radical pairs, which might subsequently recombine).
 </p>
 <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In contrast, higher fields affect the radical recombination via the Zeeman effect, energetically isolating the 
  <span class="italic">S</span>/
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>0</sub> manifold from the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>+</sub>/
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>−</sub> levels, therefore impeding efficient singlet–triplet mixing. Following the arguments above, this results in a decrease in radical concentration at early times after the laser pulse and a corresponding increase on longer timescales.
 </p>
 <p id="Par26" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">It is, at first sight, perhaps surprising that the MFE data obtained at intermediate times, namely, 0.28 μs after the laser pulse, do not exhibit a sign inversion of the MFE. This finding is, however, in agreement with the results in ref. 
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
  </span> in which it was demonstrated that the field effects on the populations of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>0</sub> and 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>+</sub>/
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>−</sub> are not only in opposite directions but evolve at different timescales. While the initially positive LFE has, at 0.28 μs, already changed sign, the high-field effect lags about 0.2 μs behind in its evolution (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>).
 </p>
 <p id="Par27" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Complementary experiments were also performed on a partially deuterated analogue of the 
  <span class="bold">CPF</span> triad, from now on referred to as 
  <span class="bold">CPF</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="bold">D</span>
  </sub>, the chemical structure of which is shown in Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a>. Significantly different MFE traces were recorded, while the kinetics of both triad molecules in the absence of any applied field were identical within experimental error (see Supplementary Fig. 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>). The observed dependencies of the position and amplitude of the low- and high-field effects are in agreement with the reduced effective hyperfine coupling in the carotenoid radical (the gyromagnetic ratio of the deuteron is approximately a factor of 6.5 smaller than that of the proton). A reduction in this effective coupling is expected to result in a reduction of the size of the LFE and a shift of the maximum of the LFE to smaller fields
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44" href="#CR44">44</a>,
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45" href="#CR45">45</a>
  </span>, in agreement with Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>. A detailed interpretation of the difference in the time evolution of the field effects is more complex since the probabilities of finding the radical pair in the triplet and singlet states are determined by an intricate interplay of hyperfine couplings, applied magnetic field strengths and kinetics
