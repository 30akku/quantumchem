  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-f002">Figure 2</a>a,b shows normalized photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the synthesized double-halide CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> (X = Cl, Br, or I) PQDs. With an increasing molar ratio of Br/Cl, the PL emission of the double-halide CsPb(Cl/Br)
  <sub>3</sub> PQDs moved gradually from 410 to 515 nm. In the same way, the PL emission of the double-halide CsPb(Br/I)
  <sub>3</sub> PQDs changed gradually from 515 to almost 692 nm. With the purpose of controlling the PL emission wavelength more accurately, a series of triple-halide CsPb(Cl/Br/I)
  <sub>3</sub> PQDs were synthesized and studied. Specifically, the amount of added PbCl
  <sub>2</sub> remained the same while the molar ratio of I/Br was adjusted. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-f002" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-f002">Figure 2</a>c, a difference with the double-halide PQDs was that the central wavelength of the emission peak was positively proportional to the molar ratio of I/Br. A linear relation between the peak and molar ratio could be obtained by curve fitting. The results indicate that quantum dots with full-spectrum (410–700 nm) luminescence could be synthesized by all three kinds of halogen doping.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Specifically, for one certain concentration of a mixed halide, more than five atom-structure models with different halide atom arrangements were used for simulations of the double/triple CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> PDQs. The model with the smallest calculated value of ΔH was considered the most stable, which was then used to simulate this particular concentration of the mixed-halide perovskite. Among these structures, relatively, the largest positive value of formation energy for the triple-halide-structure 3 (ΔH = 0.275 eV) indicates that this structure is the most unstable one (as shown in 
  <a rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-t001" ref-type="table" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-t001">Table 1</a>, 
  <a rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-t002" ref-type="table" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-t002">Table 2</a> and 
  <a rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-t003" ref-type="table" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-t003">Table 3</a>). Subsequently, we performed molecular dynamics simulations to examine the structural stability of the triple-halide-3 at a room temperature of 300 K. The simulation indicated that the structure of triple-halide-structure 3 did not show obvious changes, suggesting that crystals with this structure are metastable at least. Thus, the stability of triple-halide-structure 3 with the largest calculated value of ΔH implies that the other structures of the mixed-halide perovskite with the smaller value of ΔH are more stable or actually stable. Calculating the electronic structures of the mixed-halide perovskites, it was found that the band gaps of CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> were underestimated compared with the experimental data of the emission peaks due to the nature of the PBE method, as seen in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-f003" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-f003">Figure 3</a>b. Therefore, to properly characterize the change of trends of the band gaps, we used the formulations given in the 
  <a ref-type="app" rid="app1-nanomaterials-09-00172" href="#app1-nanomaterials-09-00172">Appendix A</a> to correct the results, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="nanomaterials-09-00172-f003" href="#nanomaterials-09-00172-f003">Figure 3</a>c where the corrected band gaps then get close to the experimental values). The band gaps of the mixed-halide perovskite are a function of the mixed-halide ratio, and agreed with the experimental emission peaks. One can thus understand that the band gap of the perovskite can be tuned by changing the mixed-halide ratio, which is the fundamental reason for the realization of full-spectrum luminescence (410–700 nm) of double/triple CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> PQDs. In particular, all the mixed-halide perovskites have a direct band structure, which contributes to the high photoemission quantum yields for perovskites with mixed halides.
