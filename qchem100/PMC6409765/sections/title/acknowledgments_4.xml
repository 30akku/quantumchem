 <p>H.Å and X.L. (Xiyu Li) thank the US air Force of Scientific Research for the Cooperative Agreement Award for the project “Multiscale modelling of 2D Inorganic-Organic Hybrid Materials for Nonlinear Optics” (Award No. FA9550-18-1-0032). They also thank Sai Duan for valuable advice. The calculations were supported by the Swedish National Infrastructure for Computing (SNIC) and were performed within the project “Multiphysical Simulation of Molecular Materials” SNIC 2017/12-49.</p>
