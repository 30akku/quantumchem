 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we synthesized all-inorganic CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> (X = Cl, Br, I) perovskite quantum dots with full-spectrum (410–700 nm) luminescence by means of the hot-injection method using the molar ratio of Br/Cl and I/Br to precisely control the luminescence wavelength. Based on the DFT method, we theoretically explored the properties of CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> with double/triple anion atoms. The calculated band gaps strongly support the variation of the emission peaks upon the mixed-halide ion ratio. The results of the calculations suggest that the change of the mixed-halide ion ratio is the fundamental reason for the realization of the full-spectrum luminescence (410–700 nm) of double/triple CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> materials. A series of down-converted LED devices was systematically investigated, indicating that the as-prepared CsPbX
  <sub>3</sub> PQDs could be promising materials for future applications in full-spectrum display devices.
