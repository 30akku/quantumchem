 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have proposed methods to perform feasible digital and digital-analog quantum simulations of molecular structures and biomolecules with the state-of-the-art of superconducting circuit technology. We analyse different quantum chemistry models by increasing gradually the complexity, moving from purely fermionic models of molecular structures to descriptions of charge transport in biomolecules embedded in a bosonic medium. We aim to profit from the unique features of cQED, such as the strong coupling of a two-level system to bosonic modes, in order to represent controllable scenarios in which quantum chemistry and quantum biology models may be studied. The proposal includes a purely digital quantum simulation protocol for fermionic models, for which we provide general methods of encoding and the sequence of gates needed for the particular case of simulation of the H
  <sub>2</sub> molecule. The previous formalism is partially used for simulating biomolecules affected by their bosonic surroundings, where we also add analog blocks with a multimode cavity playing the role of the bosonic bath, hence boosting the efficiency of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry.
