Single-qubit gate errors are neglected due to their high fidelity with current technology. If the dominating error is the experimental one, then the aim is to reduce the number of gates and, consequently, the regular protocol gets better fidelities. In

On the left side of the crossing points, the experimental error is smaller and the symmetric protocol provides better results, whereas on the right side, as the experimental gate error grows, the regular protocol is more adequate. We also notice that, as the number of Trotter steps increases, the advantages of one protocol with respect to the other lessen.

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b65" href="#b65">65</a>. Additionally, it can also be proven that a simple tunable Ohmic bath, as the one provided by a transmission line, equipped with a feedback protocol, can produce highly non-Markovian dynamics
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b66" href="#b66">66</a>. Growing in electronic complexity in 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq14" href="#eq14">equation (9)</a> implies adding more qubits coupled to the transmission line in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="f4" href="#f4">Fig. 4</a>. However, we can take full advantage of the same multimode cavity by encoding the bath in a similar fashion. Hence, the cQED setup may be easily scaled up by coupling more qubits to the same transmission line.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Let us discuss how the Hamiltonian in 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq17" href="#eq17">equation (10)</a> is decomposed into different digital and digital-analog blocks for the quantum simulation. As in the previous subsection, the purely electronic subsystem can be decomposed in Trotter steps and reproduced by single- and two-qubit gates. Since the bosonic operators do not enter in this part, we must decouple the tunable qubits from the transmission line to perform the required gates. The remaining terms are encoded in digital-analog blocks, where we divide the dynamics in different Trotter steps in which the multimode cavity enters in an analog way, providing the free energy of the bosons, and simulating the last term of 
   <a ref-type="disp-formula" rid="eq17" href="#eq17">equation (10)</a>. This last term is composed of purely bosonic interactions proportional to

   </div>, which may be simulated through a microwave driving in the cavity. It also involves qubit-boson interactions,

    <span id="d33e702" xlink:href="srep27836-m29.jpg" class="inline-graphic" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"/>
   </div>, which emerge from the coupling of each qubit with the multimode cavity, as in ref. 
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b35" href="#b35">35</a>. A future analysis of the error in this protocol may include not only the error of the two-qubit gates, but also the contribution of the imperfect decoupling of the qubits with the transmission line in the single-qubit gates in which we introduce the coupling with the bosonic degrees of freedom. The figure of merit in the simulation is the final state of the fermions, which may be extracted from the final state of the qubits. The quantum simulation may be performed for different final times, thereby allowing us to reconstruct the electronic dynamics, such as transfer of excitations.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">With this proposal, we have provided not only a way of extracting results illustrating different charge transport regimes in biomolecules, but also a way of testing different minimal models for describing molecules embedded in a bosonic environment. Superconducting circuits are a controllable quantum platform in which we can tune couplings between spins and bosons, and manipulate external conditions to engineer different baths. We analyse models of biological systems with a certain complexity and translate them to a controllable superconducting device that enjoys a similar complexity.</p>
