 <p>New N-propargyl tetrahydroquinolines 
  <span class="bold">6a-g</span> have been synthesized efficiently through the cationic Povarov reaction (a domino Mannich/Friedel-Crafts reaction), catalyzed by Indium (III) chloride (InCl
  <sub>3</sub>), from the corresponding 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-propargylanilines preformed, formaldehyde and 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-vinylformamide, with good to moderate yields. All tetrahydroquinoline derivatives obtained were evaluated 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> as free radical scavengers. Results showed that compound 
  <span class="bold">6c</span> presents a potent antioxidant effect compared with ascorbic acid, used as a reference compound. ADME predictions also revealed favorable pharmacokinetic parameters for the synthesized compounds, which warrant their suitability as potentials antioxidant. Additionally, a theoretical study using Molecular Quantum Similarity and reactivity indices were developed to discriminate different reactive sites in the new molecules in which the oxidative process occurs.
