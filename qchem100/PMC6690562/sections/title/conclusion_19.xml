 <p id="p0170" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, the synthesis of a new series of substituted 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-propargylTHQs derivatives has been developed in mild conditions and simple procedure through the Domino Mannich/Friedel - Crafts reactions using InCl
  <sub>3</sub> as catalyst. The antioxidant activity is dependent on the concentration of the compounds, likewise, the compound 
  <span class="bold">6c</span> and 
  <span class="bold">6g</span> (with methoxy and fluorine group on the aromatic ring respectively) presented the most favorable antioxidant activity values. Physicochemical descriptors, calculated theoretically, indicated that the new compounds have a low toxicity risk. Structurally the 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-propargyl THQs are attractive for the production of a second generation of compounds due to the reactivity of the propargyl fragment. In this study, we obtained compounds with higher antioxidant capacity than the reference compound. From the theoretical calculations (MQSM, Global reactivity descriptors, and Fukui Functions), we can establish similarity and discriminate different reactive sites in the new molecules where the oxidative process occurs. These sites can be used for the design of new compounds with interesting biological activity.
