 <p id="p0095" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In a round-bottomed flask, a 5-mL solution in anhydrous DMF of the corresponding anilines 
  <span class="bold">1</span> (1.8 mmol), potassium iodide (0.1 mmol) and anhydrous sodium carbonate (2 mmol) was prepared and stirred constantly at 0 °C. A solution of propargyl bromide 
  <span class="bold">2</span> (1.0 mmol) in anhydrous DMF was added dropwise and the mixture was kept at 0 °C for 20 minutes. The reaction was allowed to stir at room temperature for 3–4 h, indicated on TLC. The reaction mixture was diluted with water and extracted with ethyl acetate (3 × 20 mL), the organic phase was separated and dried (Na
  <sub>2</sub>SO
  <sub>4</sub>), the solvent removed under vacuum and the resulting product was purified by column chromatography on silica gel, (petroleum ether: ethyl acetate) to obtain the pure
