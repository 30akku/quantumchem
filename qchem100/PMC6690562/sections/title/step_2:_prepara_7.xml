 <p id="p0100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All the reactions were performed at room temperature. In a round bottom flask, a 5 mL solution in CH
  <sub>3</sub>CN of preformed 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-propargylaniline 
  <span class="bold">3a-g</span> (1.0 mmol) and formaldehyde (37% in methanol) 
  <span class="bold">4</span> (1.1 mmol) was prepared and stirred for 10 minutes. 5 mL solution of InCl
  <sub>3</sub> (20% mol) in CH
  <sub>3</sub>CN was then added. After 20 minutes a solution of 
  <span class="italic">N-</span>vinylformamide 
  <span class="bold">5</span> (1.1 mmol) in CH
  <sub>3</sub>CN was incorporated to the reaction mixture and was vigorously stirred. The resulting mixture was stirred for 3â€“4 h. After the workup, the final product was purified by column chromatography, eluted with the appropriate mixture of petroleum ether and ethyl acetate to afford pure THQs
