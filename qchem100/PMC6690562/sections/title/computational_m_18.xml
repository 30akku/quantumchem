 <p id="p0165" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The theoretical study was realized based on Molecular Quantum Similarity Measure (MQSM), density functions, analyzing a series of reactive descriptors as chemical hardness (η), chemical potential (μ), electrophilicity index (ω), softness(s), and Fukui functions. All the structures included in this study were optimized at B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory by using the Gaussian 09 package (
