 <p id="p0140" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">DPPH is a stable free radical that can accept an electron or hydrogen radical to become a stable molecule. The antioxidant activity can be observed by a change of coloration deep violet to yellow in the mixture of compounds with a methanolic solution of DPPH. The hydrogen atom or electron donation ability of the compounds was measured from the bleaching of the purple colored methanol solution of DPPH (

 <p id="p0145" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The free radical scavenging effect of the compounds was assessed by the discoloration of a methanolic solution of DPPH as previously reported (

  <span class="bold">g</span> was assayed at 100, 50 and 10 μg/mL. The scavenging of free radicals by THQs was evaluated spectrophotometrically at 517 nm against the absorbance of the DPPH radical. The percentage of discoloration was calculated as follows:

  <sub>50</sub> value of 1 μg/mL.
