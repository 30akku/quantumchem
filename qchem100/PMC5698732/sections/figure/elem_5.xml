  <p>Experimental and calculated 
   <span class="sup">1</span>H NMR spectra of nonactin (500 MHz, in CDCl
   <sub>3</sub>). The conformer ensemble consists of three dominating species with populations of 7, 9, and 81 %. The top spectrum refers to a 
   <span class="italic">C</span>
   <sub>2</sub>‐symmetric conformer that does not contribute but is lowest in the GFN‐xTB ensemble. Impurities are indicated by arrows. The signals appearing at around 4.3 ppm in the simulation are an overlay of two bands found experimentally at 3.8 and 4.0 ppm, respectively.
