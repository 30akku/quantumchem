  <p>Constituent elements of the strongly coupled system. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Strong interaction between a collective plasmon excitation of an Al
   <sub>201</sub> nanoparticle and a molecular resonance of benzene results in the formation of lower and upper polariton states. Insets show the induced charge densities at resonances. The spectra are to scale but offset for clarity. 
   <span class="bold">b</span>–
   <span class="bold">e</span> Transition contribution maps (TCMs) of the (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) plasmon and (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) molecular resonance show, respectively, the collective and discrete nature of these resonances. TCMs for 
   <span class="bold">d</span> the lower polariton (6.9 eV) and 
   <span class="bold">e</span> the upper polariton (7.7 eV) show the mixture of plasmonic and molecular transition contributions. The molecular transition (from about −2 to 3 eV) shows a clear symmetric and antisymmetric character with respect to the low-energy (≲2 eV) plasmonic transitions at the lower and upper polaritons, respectively, and the induced densities at the polariton energies visualize the corresponding in-phase and out-of-phase alignments (insets of panel 
   <span class="bold">a</span>). In the density of states the red line marks the contribution from benzene, multiplied by 5 for visibility, and the vacuum level at around 4 eV is marked by a dashed line
