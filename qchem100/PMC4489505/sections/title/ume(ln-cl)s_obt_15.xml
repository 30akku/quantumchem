  <sub>(Ln-Cl)</sub>s obtained using the RM1 model for the lanthanides and all five versions of the Sparkle Model: Sparkle/RM1, Sparkle/PM7, Sparkle/PM6, Sparkle/PM3 and Sparkle/AM1 for all complexes of the universe set for each of the lanthanide trications: La(III), Ce(III) and Pr(III).
 </div>
 <p>The UMEs are calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the experimental and calculated Ln-Cl interatomic distances, summed up for all complexes, for each of the lanthanides.</p>
