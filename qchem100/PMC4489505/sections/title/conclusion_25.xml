 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The overall advantage of the RM1 model for the lanthanides presented in this article is that it can perform a full geometry optimization on a complex such as the tetramer of praseodymium, [Pr
  <sub>4</sub>Cl
  <sub>10</sub>(OH)
  <sub>2</sub>(thiazole)
  <sub>8</sub>(H
  <sub>2</sub>O)
  <sub>2</sub>], with relative ease; something that would be exceedingly difficult for an ab initio type calculation. The same can be said of calculations on the three-dimensional 5-aminoisophtalate Pr(III) polymeric complex, which presents good gas storage capabilities [

Even if ab initio calculations would be later needed for specific properties that could not be obtained at useful accuracy levels by any other means, they could be carried out on RM1 optimized geometriesâ€”something that could save an enormous amount of computing time and resources.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, the previous sparkle models seem to be very good models provided the complex has only nitrogen or oxygen directly coordinated to the lanthanide ion. However, if the complex of interest has other types of atoms directly coordinated to the lanthanide ion, then the RM1 model for the lanthanides, introduced in this article, must be the method of choice.</p>
