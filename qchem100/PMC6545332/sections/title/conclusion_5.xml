  <span class="italic">GaAs</span> QD has been rigorously explored. The noise-BE interplay does not qualitatively affect the CF as under all situations CF declines with enhancement of BE. The said interplay, however, displays some noticeable role in case of DCKE and EAC. For these two properties the mode of introduction of noise modulates the said interplay. Both of these properties exhibit steady drop and blue-shift as BE increases; without noise and when additive noise operates. Presence of multiplicative noise, though does not affect the general trend of peak shift, but causes maximization of peak height at
