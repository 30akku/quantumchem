 <p>Present investigation focuses on analyzing the role of 
  <span class="italic">noise-binding energy (BE) interplay</span> on the 
  <span class="italic">correction factors (CF)</span> related to 
  <span class="italic">Kerr nonlinearity</span>, 
  <span class="italic">DC-Kerr effect (DCKE)</span> and 
  <span class="italic">electro-absorption coefficient (EAC)</span> of 
  <span class="italic">GaAs</span> quantum dot (QD) contaminated with impurity under the active presence of 
  <span class="italic">Gaussian white noise</span>. The dopant impurity is modeled by a Gaussian potential. The noise-BE interplay does not give rise to any new interesting feature in case of CF from that in absence of noise. However, the said interplay prominently influences the DCKE and EAC profiles. This is justified by the emergence of distinct qualitative characteristics in the DCKE and EAC profiles that evidently depend on the mode of introduction of noise.
