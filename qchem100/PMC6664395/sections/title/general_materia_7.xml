  <span class="sup">1</span>H NMR and 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR spectra were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AMX–400 spectrometer (operating at 400 MHz for 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H NMR and 100 MHz for 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR) in CDCl
  <sub>3</sub> with TMS as an internal standard. Due to the poor solubility, NMR spectra of 
  <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> were recorded at room temperature on a Bruker AMX-600 spectrometer (operating at 600 MHz for 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H NMR and 151 MHz 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR) in CDCl
  <sub>3</sub>. High-resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were measured using a Waters-Q-TOF Premiers (ESI) apparatus. UV–vis spectra were obtained on a JASCO v-650 spectrometer. Fluorescence spectra and fluorescence lifetime decay measurements were recorded on a HORIBA FluoroMax–4 (TCSPC) spectrofluorimeter. Circular dichroism spectra were measured on a JASCO J-1500 spectrometer using a quartz cuvette of 1 cm path length installed in a Unisoku cryostat. Dynamic light scattering (DLS) studies were done on a Zetasizer Nano ZS90 instrument. A preparative Chiralpak IA column was used for the separation of enantiomers.
