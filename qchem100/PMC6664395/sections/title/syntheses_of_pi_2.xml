  <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> was synthesized by following our previously reported processes [
  <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">34</a>], and 
  <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> was synthesized by the processes illustrated in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="C1" href="#C1">Scheme 1</a>. The ethynyl-bearing pillar[5]arene derivative 
  <span class="bold">P5A</span> was obtained through the co-cyclization of 4.0 equiv of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene with 1.0 equiv of the hydroquinone derivative 
  <span class="bold">7</span> and 5.0 equiv of paraformaldehyde in the presence of BF
  <sub>3</sub>·OEt
  <sub>2</sub> [
  <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>–
  <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">41</a>]. The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/ethyl acetate 10:1 as the eluent. The first fraction was permethylated pillar[5]arene, and 
  <span class="bold">P5A</span> was collected as the second fraction in 45% yield. The subsequent reaction of compound 
  <span class="bold">P5A</span> with the azide-substituted DPA derivative 
  <span class="bold">DPA-6</span> was carried out in the presence of CuSO
  <sub>4</sub>·5H
  <sub>2</sub>O (2.0 equiv) and sodium ascorbate (4.0 equiv) for 24 h in DMF at 65 °C giving 
  <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> in almost quantitative conversion (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="C1" href="#C1">Scheme 1</a>). The crude product was separated from CuSO
  <sub>4</sub> and sodium ascorbate through extraction with Et
  <sub>2</sub>O/water. Further purification of the crude product was carried out by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol 30:1) to afford 
  <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> in 72% yield. The structure of 
  <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> was characterized by 
  <span class="sup">1</span>H NMR, 
  <span class="sup">13</span>C NMR and high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>, Figures S19–S21).
