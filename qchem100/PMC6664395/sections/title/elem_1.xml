   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> was synthesized by following our previously reported processes [
   <a rid="R34" ref-type="bibr" href="#R34">34</a>], and 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> was synthesized by the processes illustrated in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="C1" href="#C1">Scheme 1</a>. The ethynyl-bearing pillar[5]arene derivative 
   <span class="bold">P5A</span> was obtained through the co-cyclization of 4.0 equiv of 1,4-dimethoxybenzene with 1.0 equiv of the hydroquinone derivative 
   <span class="bold">7</span> and 5.0 equiv of paraformaldehyde in the presence of BF
   <sub>3</sub>·OEt

   <a rid="R40" ref-type="bibr" href="#R40">40</a>–
   <a rid="R41" ref-type="bibr" href="#R41">41</a>]. The product was purified by silica gel column chromatography with hexane/ethyl acetate 10:1 as the eluent. The first fraction was permethylated pillar[5]arene, and 
   <span class="bold">P5A</span> was collected as the second fraction in 45% yield. The subsequent reaction of compound 
   <span class="bold">P5A</span> with the azide-substituted DPA derivative 
   <span class="bold">DPA-6</span> was carried out in the presence of CuSO
   <sub>4</sub>·5H
   <sub>2</sub>O (2.0 equiv) and sodium ascorbate (4.0 equiv) for 24 h in DMF at 65 °C giving 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> in almost quantitative conversion (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="C1" href="#C1">Scheme 1</a>). The crude product was separated from CuSO
   <sub>4</sub> and sodium ascorbate through extraction with Et
   <sub>2</sub>O/water. Further purification of the crude product was carried out by silica gel column chromatography (dichloromethane/methanol 30:1) to afford 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> in 72% yield. The structure of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> was characterized by

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The photophysical properties were investigted by UV–vis absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, as well as through fluorescence decay measurements. As shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, the UV–vis spectrum of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> showed two main absorption bands at 270–320 nm and 350–420 nm, respectively, which were assigned to the absorption bands of the pillar[5]arene moiety and the π→π* transition of the DPA fragment, respectively. The absorption spectra of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> and 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> are almost the result of the addition of the spectra of pillar[5]arene with 
   <span class="bold">DPA-6</span> and 
   <span class="bold">Py-6</span>. The molar extinction coefficient at the longer wavelength for 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> was almost double that of 
   <span class="bold">DPA-6</span>, e.g., ε = 23100 M cm

   <span class="sup">−1</span> for

   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> at the ground state. Similar results were observed for

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fluorescence spectrum of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> is very similar to that of 
   <span class="bold">DPA-6</span> (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> showed an intense fluorescence in the visible light region, peaked at 420 nm with a shoulder at 437 nm and a fluorescence quantum yield as high as 89.5%, which is very close to that of 
   <span class="bold">DPA-6</span> (Φ
   <sub>F</sub> = 92.1%). For 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span>, however, it showed a slightly red-shifted emission compared with 
   <span class="bold">Py-6</span>, with the emission peaks at 456 nm and 483 nm and a shoulder at 516 nm (
   <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a>). The quantum yield was significantly decreased to 46.4% compared with 78.2% for 
   <span class="bold">Py-6</span>. We ascribed the decreased fluorescence of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> to the π–π stacking of the Py units caused by the high local concentration of perylene. For 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span>, which also bears two DPA units in one macrocyclic host, the fluorescent quantum yield was only slightly decreased. This should be mainly due to the steric hindrance of the 9- and 10-phenyl groups, which inhibited the π–π stacking of the anthracene core in DPA.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Due to the fact that the Py and DPA units are too large to enter the cavity of the pillar[5]arene, we expected that the oxygen-through-annulus rotation is blocked in 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> and 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span>, giving rise to two pairs of enantiomeric pillar[5]arene derivatives. The racemic mixtures of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> and 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> were respectively separated by chiral high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). As shown in 
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>, injection of a 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> solution onto a DAICEL CHIRALPAK IA chiral HPLC column afforded two well-separated peaks of almost equal areas at 8.8 min and 10.0 min, respectively, demonstrating that

The two fractions were collected separately and re-injected into the chiral column to confirm the enantiomeric purity and to check if racemization of the enantiomers takes place in solution at room temperature. In both cases, only the original peak was detected and the peak for the antipodal enantiomer was not detected, indicating that no racemization of the enantiomer of

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>) in this region. The same is true for 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span> (
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>, Figure S22d and e). We attributed the absence of induced CD signals to the long distances of the fluorophores to the chiral center and therefore chirality transfer is non-effective [

   <a rid="R51" ref-type="bibr" href="#R51">51</a>]. We therefore further investigated the solvent-induced aggregation behaviors of the chirally pure conformers by adding different proportions of water into their THF solutions. Taking the 
   <span class="italic">R</span>
   <span class="italic">
    <sub>p</sub>
   </span> conformers for example, the aggregation of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> is apparently divided into two stages (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). By adding 50% water to THF, the UV–vis absorption wavelength of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span> did not change but the CD signals were obviously enhanced. This is most probably due to the formation of aggregates and the rotation of the phenolic units in pillar[5]arene host was inhibited in the aggregates. The aggregation behavior was further investigated by dynamic light scattering (DLS) analyses, and revealed the formation of nanoparticles with 615 nm in average diameter after the addition of 50% water (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). Increasing the amount of water to 70% or 90% led to a bathochromic shift of the UV–vis absorption and a raise of the baseline, indicating particles of larger size were formed. The CD signals continuously increased accompanied with a red-shifting of the wavelength, thus demonstrating that the DPA pigments started to aggregate in solutions with a water content of more than 50%. The π–π stacking of the anthracene core in DPA is responsible for the red-shift of the absorption. For 
   <span class="bold">P5A-Py</span>, however, adding water to the THF solution led to a continuous red-shifting of the UV–vis spectra and increasing of CD signal, which is reasonable, as the planar structure of Py tends more to get aggregated in water by π–π stacking. Aggregates with an average diameter of 531 nm are formed in 60% water (Figure S23, 
   <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1" href="#SD1">Supporting Information File 1</a>) [
   <a rid="R52" ref-type="bibr" href="#R52">52</a>]. Exciton coupling CD (ECCD) signals were not observed for both compounds, even when adding more than 90% water, demonstrating that the chromophores DPA or Py units were not asymmetrically oriented in the aggregates.

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Interestingly, by adding water into the THF solution of 
   <span class="bold">P5A-DPA</span>, the fluorescence intensity firstly increased by 3 times at 50% water and then decreased when the water content was increased to 70% (
   <a ref-type="fig" rid="F4" href="#F4">Fig. 4</a>). We attributed the enhanced emission of
