  <p>Energy dependence of the ics for the reactions of the F atom with H

   <span class="bold">(A)</span>, and D
   <sub>2</sub>, panel 
   <span class="bold">(B)</span>, molecules in their ground roto-vibrational state. The solid black and red lines are the results using SW PES and PES-II, respectively. The dot-dashed lines show the fittings of numerically exact ics to the Wigner threshold law (Equation 8). A pattern of 
   <span class="italic">J</span>-selected resonance peaks appears in the cold energy region. The value of the total angular momentum quantum number where the peaks show up in the reaction probabilities is indicated. Blue dots with error bars are the experimental values of reference (Che et al.,
