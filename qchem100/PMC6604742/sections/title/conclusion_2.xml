 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have successfully prepared a chloro-substituted BN-phenanthrene derivative that serves as a useful intermediate for the synthesis of a range of BN-phenanthrenes substituted with groups of diverse nature at C-7. This efficient post-functionalization methodology allows the influence of substituents on the photophysical properties of the BN-phenanthrene core to be studied. Substituted derivatives show an improved quantum yield with respect to the parent BN-phenanthrene, an effect that is particularly noteworthy for alkynyl substituents. A BN-phenanthrene bearing the triple bond at C-1 shows a similar increase in the quantum yield, thus suggesting that the influence of the alkynyl substituent is not limited to a particular position. We consider that this discovery may have important implications in the discovery of novel BN-arenes with improved properties. Further studies into the effect of alkynyl substituents on the fluorescence of BN-arenes are currently ongoing in our laboratories.</p>
