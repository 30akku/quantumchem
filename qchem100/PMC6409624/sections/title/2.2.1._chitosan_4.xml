 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Chitosan-based CQDs were prepared in microwave radiation fields using a Prolabo Synthwave 402 reactor according to data given in 
  <a rid="nanomaterials-09-00274-t001" ref-type="table" href="#nanomaterials-09-00274-t001">Table 1</a>. CQDs were simultaneously functionalized by N-doping with amino acids and casein hydrolysate as modifying agents. Briefly, for the CQDs synthesis and modification chitosan (0.25 g), HCl (0.10 mL) and appropriate functionalizing agents were placed into the reaction vessel and subjected to microwave radiation (300 W).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The post-reaction mixture was diluted with distilled water and treated in an ultrasonic bath for 10 min. Next, the mixture was filtrated on filter paper to remove large particles. Thereafter, the mixture was neutralized to pH = 7 using NaOH solution and filtrated by membrane filters (0.22 Âµm). In the next step, the obtained CQDs were purified using dialysis tubing (MWCO 500-1000) method to separate nanomaterials from other by-products such as low molecular weight molecules. Dialysis was conducted for 4 days. The solvent was exchanged daily. The prepared solutions were diluted with distilled water and used for the experiments.</p>
