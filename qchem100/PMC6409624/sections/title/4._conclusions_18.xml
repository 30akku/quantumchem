 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this study was to develop novel type of nanobiomaterials for biomedical applications with advanced properties using only biocompatible components. A successful attempt was made to obtain chitosan-based carbon quantum dots in a fast and efficient manner according to Green Chemistry principles. Chitosan QCDs were prepared with simultaneous functionalization using amino acids under microwave-assisted conditions which resulted in the preparation of carbon nanodots with very good photoluminescence properties. The microwave radiation enabled chitosan crosslinking followed by carbonization. The research showed that the best modifying agent is lysine which enabled 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-doping reactions resulting in a high quantum yield of the nanoparticles. The nanoparticles had spherical shape typical for CQDs. Moreover, perfumed XTT test as well as morphological studies on human dermal fibroblasts confirmed the lack of cytotoxicity of the prepared biomaterials. Overall, it can be stated that the proposed synthesis pathway enabled obtaining chitosan-based quantum dots with a high potential in biomedical applications such as cell labelling, diagnostics, theragnostics as well as in controlled drug delivery systems.
