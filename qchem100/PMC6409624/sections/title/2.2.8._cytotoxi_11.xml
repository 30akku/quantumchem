 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cytotoxicity of the prepared CQDs was investigated by a fast and sensitive XTT assay method. Experiments were carried out using primary cells - human dermal fibroblasts (HDF). XTT test enable determination of the cell viability by enzymatic reactions in which viable cells convert water-soluble XTT salt into a water-soluble, orange formazan product. For the experiments all vessels were sterilized using an autoclave. HDF were cultured in ready to use complete fibroblast growth medium. The medium was changed every two days. Cell culture was performed for 5 days. HDF were cultured at 37 °C, 5% CO
  <sub>2</sub> and 95% humidity. For the CQDs testing 96-hole plates were used. The cell culture with CQDs solutions lasted 48 h. Each experiment was repeated 5 times. The morphology of the cultured cells was investigated using an inverted microscope under 40× magnification.
