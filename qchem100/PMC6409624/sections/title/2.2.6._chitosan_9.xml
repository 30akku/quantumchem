 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Fluorescence measurements were performed using an Ocean Optics 2000 spectro-fluorimeter for non-diluted CQD solutions. Measurements were conducted using cuvettes with an optical length of 1 cm with the integration time of 10,000 ms. Fluorescence excitation was performed with an UV light-emitting diode with an emission maximum at 365 nm using distilled water as a blank probe.</p>
