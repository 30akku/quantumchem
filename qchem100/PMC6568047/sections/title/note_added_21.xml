 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">After this work was released as a preprint, a notable related work was released online.
  <a rid="cit81" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit81">81</a> That paper provides a quantum algorithm for efficiently calculating the entire converged Franck–Condon profile, as opposed to the method we present herein, which calculates a single Franck–Condon factor. However, the techniques we have discussed for finding vibrational ground states and thermal states provide a way to realise the crucial first step of their algorithm. As such, our two works are highly complementary, and can be compared.
