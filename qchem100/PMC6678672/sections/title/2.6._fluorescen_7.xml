 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prepared N-CQDs were diluted 10, 20, 50, 60, 100, 200, and 500 times by ultrapure water, and the fluorescence intensity was measured by a fluorescence spectrometer. All fluorescence spectra had an excitation wavelength of 400 nm and an emission intensity of 546 nm.</p>
