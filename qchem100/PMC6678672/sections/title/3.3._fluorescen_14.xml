  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f004" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f004">Figure 4</a>a, we found an excitation peak around 400 nm. When excited at 400 nm, the N-CQDs exhibited strong photoluminescence (PL) emission centered at 546 nm. The fluorescence intensities of N-CQDs at different dilutions were measured by fluorescence spectrometry (
