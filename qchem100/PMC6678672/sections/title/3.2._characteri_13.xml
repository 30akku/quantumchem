  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f003">Figure 3</a>a, the fluorescence quantum yield of the prepared N-CQDs was 5.11%, as determined by the calculation formula (1) in 4.4.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The fluorescence lifetime of N-CQDs was measured by time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC). After processing and fitting the measurement data, the fluorescence lifetime was obtained, as shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f003">Figure 3</a>b. According to the exponential fitting curve in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f003" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f003">Figure 3</a>b and the data (τ
  <sub>1</sub> = 2.1605 ns, τ
  <sub>2</sub> = 6.4231 ns, B1 = 96.774 %, B2 = 184.864 %, χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> = 1.068) from fitting the parameters of the fluorescence decay curve, the average weighted lifetime of fluorescence attenuation of the N-CQDs under the excitation of 400 nm was 5.79 ns, as determined by using formula (2) in 4.5, where χ
  <span class="sup">2</span> was 1.068.
