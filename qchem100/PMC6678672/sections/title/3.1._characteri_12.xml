 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, the prepared N-CQDs were tested with high-resolution TEM. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f002">Figure 2</a>a, there was no significant lattice stripe of N-CQDs, which indicated that the prepared N-CQDs were amorphous structures. As can be seen from the FT-IR spectra (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f002">Figure 2</a>b), the functional groups of N-CQDs were mainly amine (3421 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), methylene (2895, 2965 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and amide carbonyl (1716 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and the chemical bonds were C=C (1458, 1507 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), C–N (1410 cm
  <span class="sup">-1</span>), aromatic C–NH (1271 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>), and C–O (1097 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). XPS measurements were carried out to probe the N atoms in the N-CQDs. XPS full-scan spectra showed three peaks around 284.8, 399.3, and 532 eV that were ascribed to carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, respectively (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f002">Figure 2</a>c). As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f002" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f002">Figure 2</a>c,d, there was no significant difference in the concentrations of N1s at depths of 10, 20, and 30 nm from the N-CQDs surface. This indicates that the internal structure of the prepared N-CQDs was uniform. The content of N was about 16% (N/C atomic ratio is about 20.0%), which is much higher than that of various N-doped graphene-based materials (0.3–8.3%) [

  <a rid="B46-ijerph-16-02518" ref-type="bibr" href="#B46-ijerph-16-02518">46</a>]. Elemental analysis indicated that the prepared N-CQDs contained about 19% of nitrogen element.
