 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were collected from a Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope (FEI company, USA). A transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) was used for analysis of fluorescence lifetime. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High-Tech, Japan) was used for fluorescence intensity detection. An atomic absorption spectrometer (TAS990AFG, Beijing Purkinje General, China) was used to detect Ag

The characterization and structure of N-CQDs were measured by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR: TENSOR-27, Bruker, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded using an ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Elemental analysis was carried out by an Organic Elemental Analyzer (Elementar Vario EL â…¢, Elementar, Germany).
