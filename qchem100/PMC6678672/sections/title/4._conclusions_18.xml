 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, N-CQDs with yellow-green fluorescence can be easily prepared through a solvent-thermal reaction. The characterization of the prepared N-CQDs showed that N-CQDs contained various functional groups and chemical bonds that related to N, and their structure was amorphous. Meanwhile, the prepared N-CQDs showed a considerable QY (5.11%) and high chemical and optical stability. More importantly, N-CQDs showed good selectivity for and sensitivity to Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> at the concentrations of 0–10 μM and 10–30 μM, respectively. N-CQDs were used to detect the content of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> in food packaging material. The results showed that the relative error of the N-CQDs detection method with respect to the Chinese standard method was 6.24%, which means the test results of the N-CQDs detection method were reliable. The surface state of N-CQDs can be influenced by Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> ions. When N-CQDs were free in aqueous solution, they showed strong fluorescence intensity. However, in the presence of silver ions, the fluorescence of N-CQDs was significantly quenched by a charge transfer process. To sum up, the N-CQDs detection method is expected to be useful in the detection of Ag
