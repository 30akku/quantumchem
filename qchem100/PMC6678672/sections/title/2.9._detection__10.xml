 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, 3.0–4.0 g of food was transferred from the preservation box to a muffle furnace for melting at 450 °C for 4 h. First, 3.0–4.0 g of food preservation box was transferred to a muffle furnace for melting at 450 °C for 4 hours. Then, the melted samples were cooled to room temperature, and 2 mL of nitric acid was added to wet the samples. After that, each mixture was steamed until almost dry to remove the acid, and the dry samples were washed several times with 50 mL of ultrapure water. Subsequently, 2 mL of the sample solutions and 3 mL of N-CQDs were put into a colorimetric tube, followed by the addition of NaOH (0.5 mol/L) to adjust the pH to 7.0. Afterward, the fluorescence intensity was measured.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In total, 3.0 g of sample was weighed for dry incineration, and parallel experiments were carried out. The content of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> in the samples was determined by the Chinese standard method GB 11907-89.
