 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, 100 mg of 1,2,4- triaminobenzene was dissolved in 10 mL of formamide, then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber and heated at 120 Â°C for 12 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature in air atmosphere. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove large particles. Finally, the aqueous solution was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (2:8 v/v) as the eluent. The eluted mixture was condensed in a rotating evaporator to obtain the purified N-CQDs.</p>
