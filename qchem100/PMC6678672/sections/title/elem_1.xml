  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission electron microscope (TEM) images were collected from a Tecnai G2 20 transmission electron microscope (FEI company, USA). A transient fluorescence spectrometer (FLS 980, Edinburgh Instruments, UK) was used for analysis of fluorescence lifetime. A fluorescence spectrophotometer (F-7000, Hitachi High-Tech, Japan) was used for fluorescence intensity detection. An atomic absorption spectrometer (TAS990AFG, Beijing Purkinje General, China) was used to detect Ag

The characterization and structure of N-CQDs were measured by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR: TENSOR-27, Bruker, Germany). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements were recorded using an ESCALAB 250XI (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Elemental analysis was carried out by an Organic Elemental Analyzer (Elementar Vario EL Ⅲ, Elementar, Germany).

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">First, 100 mg of 1,2,4- triaminobenzene was dissolved in 10 mL of formamide, then the mixture was transferred to a Teflon-lined autoclave chamber and heated at 120 °C for 12 h. After that, the autoclave was cooled to room temperature in air atmosphere. The reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min to remove large particles. Finally, the aqueous solution was purified by silica gel column chromatography using a mixture of dichloromethane and methanol (2:8 v/v) as the eluent. The eluted mixture was condensed in a rotating evaporator to obtain the purified N-CQDs.</p>
