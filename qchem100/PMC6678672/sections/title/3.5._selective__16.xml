  <span class="sup">2+</span>, Zn

  <span class="sup">+</span> exerted a significant fluorescence quenching effect on N-CQDs, indicating that N-CQDs had a good selectivity for Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span>. This phenomenon may be due to the coordination reaction between Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> and N–H. The types of bonds between Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> and N-CQDs may be coordination interactions between Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> and C–N groups.
