 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Various concentrations of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> (0–30 μM) were added to the N-CQDs (pH = 7) to explore the performance of N-CQDs in the detection of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> in aqueous solution. It can be seen in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f005">Figure 5</a>a that the enhancement of the fluorescence quenching effect of N-CQDs can be attributed to the increase of silver ion concentration. As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="ijerph-16-02518-f005" href="#ijerph-16-02518-f005">Figure 5</a>b, as the Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> increased from 0 to 30 μM, the fluorescence quenching efficiency gradually increased. With the increase of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> concentration, the quenching efficiency of N-CQDs became increasingly higher, and the maximum efficiency was as high as 40%. The calibration curve of the quenching efficiency depending on Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> concentrations of 0–10 μM and 10–30 μM can be expressed as y = 0.00614x + 0.02296, with correlation coefficient (R
  <span class="sup">2</span>) = 0.99, and I = 0.01789C − 0.09467. The experimental data showed that the fluorescence quenching efficiency of N-CQDs in the presence of Ag
  <span class="sup">+</span> showed a linear relationship with silver ion concentrations of 0–10 μM and 10–30 μM.
