 <div class="title">Outline of the quantum-assisted optimization method.</div>
 <p>(a) The key steps for quantum assisted optimization, which starts from classical solutions. For each new set of parameters 
  <span class="italic">λ</span>'s, determined by a classical optimization algorithm, the expectation value 〈
  <span class="italic">H</span>〉 is calculated. The potential energy surface is then obtained by quantum phase estimation. (b) Quantum measurements are performed for the individual terms in 
  <span class="italic">H</span>, and the sum is obtained classically. (c) The same procedure is applied for each nuclear configuration 
  <span class="bold">R</span> to probe the energy surface.
