 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Summarizing, we have proposed a quantum simulation toolkit for quantum chemistry with trapped ions. This paradigm in quantum simulations has several advantages: an efficient electronic simulation, the possibility of interacting electronic and vibrational degrees of freedom, and the increasing scalability provided by trapped-ion systems. This approach for solving quantum chemistry problems aims to combine the best of classical and quantum computation.</p>
