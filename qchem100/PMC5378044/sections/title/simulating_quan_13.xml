 <div class="title">Simulating quantum chemistry with trapped ions.</div>
 <p>(a) Scheme of a trapped-ion setup for quantum simulation, which contains a linear chain of trapped ions confined by a harmonic potential, and external lasers that couple the motional and internal degrees of freedom. (b) Transitions between internal and motional degrees of freedom of the ions in the trap. (c) The normal modes of the trapped ions can simulate the vibrational degrees of freedom of molecules. (d) The internal states of two ions can simulate all four possible configurations of a molecular orbital.</p>
