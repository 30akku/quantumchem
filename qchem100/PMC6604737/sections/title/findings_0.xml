 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Carbon dots (C-dots) as a rising star in fluorescent nanomaterials have attracted wide attention in terms of preparation and application [
  <a rid="R1" ref-type="bibr" href="#R1">1</a>–
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>]. Fluorescent C-dots possess advantages over organic dyes and traditional semiconductor quantum dots due to their high solubility, facile modification, desirable chemical stability, and high resistance to photobleaching. Thus, fluorescent C-dots have been widely applied in the fields of imaging, catalysis, and sensing [
  <a rid="R5" ref-type="bibr" href="#R5">5</a>–
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>]. With the rapid development of fluorescent C-dots, much effort has been made to tune their electrical, optical, and chemical properties via doping and surface modification to offer novel C-dots with attracting properties [
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>]. It is worth noting that surface modification can not only tune the functional groups of fluorescent C-dots but also endow a variety of functionalities to C-dots and expand the applicability of C-dots [
  <a rid="R8" ref-type="bibr" href="#R8">8</a>–
  <a rid="R10" ref-type="bibr" href="#R10">10</a>].

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Synthetic macrocyclic compounds, especially new macrocyclic arenes, have become one of the research hotspots in supramolecular chemistry [
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>–
  <a rid="R14" ref-type="bibr" href="#R14">14</a>]. Among them pillarenes as a relatively new family of pillar-shaped members discovered a decade ago have played a key role due to their unique conformations, symmetrical structures, superior host–guest properties, supramolecular assembly characteristics, and versatile functionalities [
  <a rid="R11" ref-type="bibr" href="#R11">11</a>,
  <a rid="R15" ref-type="bibr" href="#R15">15</a>–
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a>]. Carboxylatopillar[5]arene (CP[5]) is one of the most popular functional pillarenes that has been exploited in many research areas, especially in sensing and detection [
  <a rid="R16" ref-type="bibr" href="#R16">16</a>–
  <a rid="R21" ref-type="bibr" href="#R21">21</a>]. To our best knowledge, only few reports on pillarene-modified C-dots can be found in the literature [
  <a rid="R19" ref-type="bibr" href="#R19">19</a>], not to mention their potential applications in ion sensing.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Herein, we prepare fluorescent C-dots, namely CCDs, by linking various CP[5] rings on N-doped C-dots (CN-dots) through covalent bonds formed by EDC-NHS coupling reaction. The comparison of CCDs with single CN-dots without CP[5], revealed that the CCDs exhibit a higher selectivity for Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> detection (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="C1" href="#C1">Scheme 1</a>). Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> ions play an important role in the living organism and is related to many diseases, thus it is vital to develop effective Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> sensing materials [
  <a rid="R7" ref-type="bibr" href="#R7">7</a>,
  <a rid="R22" ref-type="bibr" href="#R22">22</a>–
  <a rid="R24" ref-type="bibr" href="#R24">24</a>]. Our current strategy suggests that CCDs with excellent selectivity for Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> sensing represent a new type of advanced fluorescent sensing materials.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The sizes and morphologies of CCDs and CN-dots were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>). TEM images showed the spherical shape of CCDs with a diameter of 9 nm. For comparison, the shape of CN-dots was quasi-spherical with an average diameter of 7 nm (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>).

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>, the UV–vis absorption peak of CN-dots is at 340 nm, and CP[5] has an obvious UV–vis absorption peak at 295 nm. As expected, the UV–vis spectra of CCDs show two absorption peaks, one at 295 nm and the other at 340 nm, indicating that CP[5] has been linked on the surface of C-dots. The Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR) of C-dots, CN-dots, and CP[5] are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>. Firstly the surface of the CN-dots was investigated, the bands from 760 to 910 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were attributed to the C–H bending vibration, and the sharp absorptions at 1708, 1406, and 1176 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were assigned to the stretching vibration of –C=O, asymmetric stretching vibrations of C–N and the wagging vibration of –NH
  <sub>2</sub>, respectively. In addition, the broad band at ca. 3100 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> can be attributed to the stretching vibrations of –NH
  <sub>2</sub> and –OH bonds. As for CP[5], several characteristic absorption bands could be observed, where the broad band at 3100 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, the strong band at 1725 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, the sharp absorptions at 1502 and 1442 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, and the peaks from 650 to 910 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> were assigned to stretching vibrations of –OH bonds and –C=O group, the bending vibration of –OH, and the asymmetric stretching vibrations of C–O and C–H of benzene rings, respectively. Compared with CN-dots, the relative intensity of the asymmetric stretching vibration of C–N at 1433 cm
  <span class="sup">−1</span> in CCDs was obviously increased because the abundant amino groups of CN-dots reacted with carboxylic acid groups of the CP[5] macrocycles.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) of CCDs show the characteristic peaks of CN-dots and CP[5], further confirming the successful synthesis of CCDs. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Fig. 1</a>) revealed that the weight loss at 200 °C was due to the pyrolysis of the amino and oxygen groups on the surface of CN-dots, and upon reaching the temperature of 500 °C, CN-dots began to decompose and 61 wt % of its weight was lost until 800 °C. Meanwhile, the weight loss of CCDs reached ca. 35 wt %, indicating that ca. 26 wt % of CP[5] macrocycles were covalently grafted on the surface of CN-dots [
  <a rid="R17" ref-type="bibr" href="#R17">17</a>,

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>, the as-synthesized CN-dots material is soluble in water while the CCDs solid is insoluble. When NaOH was added slowly into the suspension of CCDs, the turbid system became clear, indicating that the CP[5] was successfully anchored on the surface of CN-dots. More intuitively, both the CCDs and the purified CN-dots emit blue fluorescence under the excitation at 365 nm, further illustrating that the CCDs retain the luminous property of CN-dots.

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>. The maximum emission and excitation wavelength of CCDs are 445 nm and 340 nm, and the maximum emission and excitation wavelength of CN-dots are 475 nm and 365 nm, which coincides with the blue light emission. The obvious blue shift was due to the modification of CP[5], which led to the increase of n–π* transition energy with the formation of new amide bonds [
  <a rid="R4" ref-type="bibr" href="#R4">4</a>,
  <a rid="R25" ref-type="bibr" href="#R25">25</a>]. The PL quantum yield (QY) of the CCDs aqueous solution was determined to be 4% (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Fig. 2</a>), while the CN-dots solution exhibited stronger emission intensity with 7% QY (

  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a> shows the fluorescence intensity change of CN-dots in the presence of metal ions. The experimental results suggested that there are several metals ions that could simultaneously quench the fluorescence of CN-dots, further indicating that CCDs is superior to CN-dots in the selective sensing of Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span>. In addition, the fluorescence intensity of CCDs decreased gradually with the stepwise addition of Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> in the range of 0–500 μM under the excitation at 340 nm (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Fig. 3</a>). As illustrated in
