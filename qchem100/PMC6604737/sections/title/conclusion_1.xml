 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, a promising fluorescent chemical sensing material (CCDs) was synthesized for the first time by covalently attaching CP[5] macrocycles onto the surface of CN-dots via EDC-NHS coupling reaction. Compared with unmodified CN-dots, CCDs demonstrated novel properties after the introduction of CP[5], and showed a higher selective sensing ability for Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> ions. Hopefully, this strategy will inspire the design of new fluorescent chemical sensors toward Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> ions with high selectivity.
