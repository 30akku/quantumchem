 <p>Fluorescent N-doped carbon dots (CN-dots) covalently functionalized with carboxylatopillar[5]arene (CP[5]), namely CCDs, have been prepared the first time. Compared with CN-dots without pillarene units, the newly constructed ï¬‚uorescent CCDs could recognize Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> with high selectivity. Therefore, such CCDs can potentially serve as a promising chemical sensor for Fe
  <span class="sup">3+</span> ions.
