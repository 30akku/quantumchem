  <p>Analysis of the cellular uptake of neutral lipodots into living duct cells. (
   <span class="bold">a</span>) Representative 2P-luminescence intensity images and corresponding 2P-FLIM images of duct cells recorded in the green (BP 514/44) and red (BP 700/75) detection channels at distinct time points. The cells were treated for 120 min with physiological saline containing 10â€‰nM DOPC:DOPE-lipodots. (
   <span class="bold">b</span>) Luminescence decay curves extracted from intracellular regions of interest from 2P-FLIM images recorded in the green detection channel. (
   <span class="bold">c</span>) Autocorrelation curves obtained from 2P-FCS line-scan measurements performed in duct cells recorded in the green detection channel.
