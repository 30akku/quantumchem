  <p>Time-dependent relative luminescence intensity changes in duct cells. Intracellular luminescence intensity changes of regions of interest were recorded during a period of 2 h for cells in physiological saline alone (grey line) and separately for cells incubated in physiological saline with 5 nM QD655 (black line) or 10 nM lipodots using one of the two different lipid compositions (red &amp; blue lines). Intensity changes relative to the starting point (
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0) were analysed from 2P-FLIM images recorded in the green detection channel; means ± SEM of 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 3–18.
