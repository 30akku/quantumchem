 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The size distribution of empty liposomes and lipodots was determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer Nano ZS (Malvern Panalytical, Kassel, Germany) equipped with a He-Ne laser source (633 nm). The detection of the scattered light occurred at an angle of 173° for reducing artefacts. The sample temperature was adjusted to 25 °C. The same setup was used to determine the zeta potential. Empty liposomes and lipodots were analysed in PBS at pH 7.4.</p>
