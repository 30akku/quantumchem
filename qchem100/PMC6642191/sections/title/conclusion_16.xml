 <p id="Par33" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this study, we for the first time characterised lipodots 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and investigated their cellular uptake into epithelial cells of a salivary gland tissue by using FLIM and FCS technique complementarily, each combined with 2P-excitation. Thus, the obtained parameters allowed for the successful characterisation of lipdot-cell-interactions (Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). With access to the microenvironment-dependent luminescence decay times and the size-dependent translational diffusion times of luminescent particles such as quantum dots, one can evaluate their encapsulation into or their release from a carrier system as well as their extra- or intracellular localisation. In combination with temporally and spectrally resolved image acquisition this can obviously improve the interpretation of lipodot-cell-interactions. Here, we encapsulated QD655 into liposomes of two different lipid compositions and surface charges. The prepared lipodots were characterised 
  <span class="italic">in vitro</span> and could be successfully applied for the cellular uptake experiments. Instead of isolated cells from cell culture, we used a living gland tissue preparation possessing cell junctions and an extracellular matrix as additional potential barriers making quantum dot uptake experiments more realistic. The lipodots showed a fast accumulation at the membrane surface. After 5-minute incubation period, we observed a cellular uptake and time-dependent changes in accumulation and intracellular distribution of quantum dots in the cytosol of the duct cells independent of the lipid composition. Luminescence decay time measurements confirmed luminescence quenching of the quantum dots, probably due to changed microenvironment and interaction of these nanoparticles with intracellular molecules. Furthermore, FCS data analysis from intracellular regions revealed diffusion of two different components, which could be attributed to possible intracellular clustering of the quantum dots and single diffusing quantum dots, respectively. By using a simple and manageable liposome carrier system, 2P-FLIM and 2P-FCS recordings can lead to new information about the stability and localisation of quantum dots within a complex biological microenvironment. This technical toolbox allows for further quantum dot-cell-interaction studies and spatiotemporal drug carrier-cell-interaction in general. Here, intact quantum dots at the outer cellular membrane and somehow degraded quantum dots within the living cells could be distinguished. However, additional experiments can be performed now, addressing the intracellular uptake and chemical modification mechanisms of lipodots. In this context, the application of functionalised liposome carrier systems is conceivable for more specific biological and clinical applications. Thereby, enhanced targeted delivery can be obtained with immunoliposomes consisting of surface-attached antibodies or their fragments and more stable, long-circulating liposomes can be realised by coating with polymers such as PEG
