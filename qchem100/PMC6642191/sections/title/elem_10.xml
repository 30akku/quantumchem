In contrast, the absorption spectrum of lipodots was the sum of scatted light from the liposomes and the absorption property of QD655 so that this resulted in a slightly changed absorption spectrum compared to that of free QD655. The luminescence spectrum of lipodots exhibited a symmetric, sharp band with a maximum at 652 nm, very similar to the luminescence spectrum of free QD655. These results suggested that the liposome-encapsulated quantum dots still exhibit a strong luminescence signal without significant quantum dot self-quenching or spectral changes. Moreover, this was a good evidence for the stability of quantum dots within the liposome microenvironment, since blue-shifted emission spectra could indicate quantum dot aggregation or even degradation

Compared to organic fluorophores and fluorescent proteins, colloidal quantum dots exhibit in general longer luminescence decay times. Their multiexponential decay behaviour is a common feature of quantum dots, although the origin of such complex behaviour is still not well understood. In the present study, we compared the luminescence decay behaviour of free QD655 and lipodots, both dissolved in PBS (Fig.

  <p id="Par25" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although the encapsulation efficiency was not analysed in detail, the complementary luminescence decay time and translational diffusion time recordings allowed for proofing an effective and stable loading of QD655 into both types of liposomes under the applied experimental conditions. First, after the extrusion process during the lipodots preparation procedure quantum dot luminescence could be detected on the membrane filters under UV light. Thus, the quantum dot sticking at the polycarbonate membrane allowed for separation of free QD655 from liposome-encapsulated QD655 as previously reported
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66" href="#CR66">66</a>

   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>av(int)</sub> ~30 ns 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. ~40–41 ns) indicating the changed quantum dot microenvironment after encapsulation. Third, the increase in the diffusion time after lipodots preparation (
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>D1</sub> ~2 ms 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. ~11 ms) indicated the recording of lipodots rather than free QD655. In addition, the very dominant relative fraction of this slow diffusion time (

  <p id="Par28" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In order to evaluate the benefit of lipodots for cellular uptake experiments, we started with incubation experiments using only free QD655. Thus, small salivary gland lobes were treated for 120 min with physiological saline containing 5 nM QD655 and the described results are representative for 
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 6 independent experiments. Since the cellular autofluorescence mainly resulted from NADH and FAD as discussed above and according to their luminescence emission maxima
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36" href="#CR36">36</a>
   </span>, the luminescence intensity within the duct cells was more pronounced in the green than in the red detection channel at 
   <span class="italic">t</span> = 0 min (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4a</a>). The bath incubation with free QD655 for 120 min did not significantly change the intracellular luminescence intensity in both detection channels. In addition, the weak intracellular luminescence decayed in the range of the measured autofluorescence (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4b</a>). However, no FCS data could be analysed due to the low luminescence signals. On the other hand, considerable QD655 luminescence could be recognised in the extracellular surrounding physiological saline, but only in the red detection channel as expected from their emission spectrum (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). The luminescence in this channel decayed triexponentially with intensity-weighted average decay times of

   <sub>av(int)</sub> = 5.8–6.3 ns at the different time points (Fig.

   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2</a>). This could be probably due to the unspecific interaction with extracellular components as well as the limited time resolution of the 2P-FLIM imaging setup compared to the 
   <span class="italic">in vitro</span> spectroscopic setup. Thus, the applied free QD655 could be not sufficiently incorporated into the duct cells and were mainly accumulated in the cellular surrounding due to sedimentation at the coverslip bottom of the recording chamber.

  <div class="title" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Cellular uptake experiments with lipodots</div>
  <p id="Par29" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Next, we focused on the potential of lipodots for cellular uptake into salivary gland duct cells. In incubation experiments similar to that performed with free QD655, small salivary gland lobes were treated for 120 min with physiological saline containing 10 nM lipodots. Prior lipodots addition, only the autofluorescence signal could be detected, as mentioned above. However, in the presence of lipodots the acquired luminescence intensity images and the corresponding 2P-FLIM images suggested a successful uptake of QD655 from the DOPC:DOPE-lipodots (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5a</a>). Since, no visible changes of the cellular morphology between lipodots-treated cells and the control untreated cells were observed, we assumed no significant cytotoxicity of QD655 in the used cells. Approximately 5 min after incubation, we observed inhomogeneously distributed bright luminescent spots within the cytosol, but excluded from the nucleus. The luminescence intensity in the cells slightly increased with acquisition time up to a saturation point at approx. 30 min. A similar uptake pattern has been reported for QD610-loaded liposomes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33" href="#CR33">33</a>
   </span> as well as for QD655 (PEG)-loaded liposomes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39" href="#CR39">39</a>
   </span>. The intracellular luminescent spots could be attributed to aggregates of quantum dots formed intracellularly

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
   </span>. Surprisingly, this luminescence signal was more pronounced in the green detection channel than in the red detection channel, although the QD655 emission maximum was observed at 652 nm (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1</a>). This in turn could by partly explained by luminescence quenching of intact quantum dots due to the changed intracellular microenvironment, especially concerning the ionic strength and possible interactions of quantum dots with cellular molecules

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
   </span>. In addition, the enhanced signal in the green detection channel indicated a blue shift in the quantum dot luminescence. This could be in fact the result of degradation processes after release of QD655 from lipodots for instance by endosomal and lysosomal activity. Moreover, we observed also an increasing clustering of luminescent particles in the extracellular surrounding medium without any changes in the red luminescence (bright red spots only in the red detection channel). This clustering behaviour of lipodots in physiological saline is different to that observed in the case of free QD655 without any liposomal carrier (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4</a>). The assumed effect of quenching and degradation of quantum dot luminescence in the cells was confirmed by the luminescence decay curves obtained from the regions of interest in the green detection channel, which were fitted to a biexponential decay function yielding reasonable residuals and reduced

  <p id="Par30" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Furthermore, we examined the diffusion behaviour of quantum dots in cells by performing line-scan FCS in the cellular regions. The cytoplasm is a heterogeneous environment consisting of internal membrane structures, cytoskeletal meshwork and other macrobiomolecules, so that the diffusive transport of molecules deviates from ideal behaviour and strongly depends on the position within the cell
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77" href="#CR77">77</a>
   </span>. It has been already reported, that while most of quantum dot aggregates in living cells are immobile, some of them move, often in a fairly straight paths in a rapidly fashion
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76" href="#CR76">76</a>
   </span>. However, Ruan 
   <span class="italic">et al</span>. postulated a random diffusion of released quantum dots in crowded cytoplasm. They estimated that the time to diffuse through a 20 µm-diameter cell for a single quantum dot of a hydrodynamic radius of 10 nm would be ~30 s, whereas it would be ≥5 h for a vesicle of a hydrodynamic size of 80 nm
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30" href="#CR30">30</a>
   </span>. However, in most cases, we could measure reasonable autocorrelation curves, that showed in general a shift to slightly longer diffusion times compared to the autocorrelation curves obtained for the intrinsic autofluorescence alone (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig5">5c</a>). While for some autocorrelation curves the diffusion times increased up to 
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>D</sub> = 1.3 ± 0.2 s (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 12), in several cases we determined two different diffusion times with 
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
   <sub>D1</sub> = 800 ± 113 ms (

   <span class="italic">f</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 39%) (
   <span class="italic">N</span> = 26). We compared these results with the diffusion times of freely diffusing QD655 in PBS and we attributed the slow diffusion component to possible intracellular quantum dots aggregates, as mentioned before. The appearance of the faster diffusion time component could be the result from single diffusing free quantum dots, even though this value is smaller than that obtained from free QD655 in PBS (see Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2b</a>). The discrepancy is probably based on the fitting procedure of the quite different time components (800 ms 
   <span class="italic">vs</span>. 1.17 ms) leading to an underestimation of the fast time component. This fact would support a successful release of quantum dots from the lipodots. Previous studies suggest that especially endocytosis and lipid-mediated fusion with the cell membranes are the major pathways for liposomal internalisation

    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78" href="#CR78">78</a>

   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>
   </span>. Since it is known, that the liposome-binding with the cell plasma membrane is non-specific and mostly driven by electrostatic interactions between the liposome carriers and proteoglycans present at the cell surface, the fusion probability of the liposomes strongly depends on their surface charge and lipid composition
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31" href="#CR31">31</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79" href="#CR79">79</a>
   </span>. It has been proposed that the use of cationic lipids is essential for increased cellular uptake of liposomes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32" href="#CR32">32</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54" href="#CR54">54</a>,
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR80" href="#CR80">80</a>
   </span>. Recently, it has been shown that in addition to neutral and cationic lipids the presence of an aromatic molecule significantly improves the fusion efficiency of liposomes
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR81" href="#CR81">81</a>
   </span>. However, in this study the presence of neutral DOPE in the lipodots was sufficient and could be reasonable for their membrane association. DOPE facilitates the internalisation by fusion with the membrane, which can be attributed to their minimally hydrated head group and the resulting high affinity toward cell membrane
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82" href="#CR82">82</a>
   </span>. This is called the transbilayer internalisation pathway
   <span class="sup">
    <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83" href="#CR83">83</a>
   </span>. Nevertheless, further studies have to be performed in future to investigate the mechanisms of cellular uptake as well as intracellular trafficking mechanism for lipodots, especially in different complex cell types.
  </p>
  <p id="Par31" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In addition, we tested the interactions of DOPC:DOPS-lipodots with salivary gland duct cells. Since DOPC:DOPS-lipodots showed a more negative zeta potential compared to DOPC:DOPE-lipodots, they could exhibit a different interaction behaviour. The 2P-FLIM images of the duct cells exposed to the negatively charged lipodots showed in addition to cytoplasmic luminescence also a strong luminescence signal at the membrane, indicating an accumulation of lipodots at the cell surface (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig6" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig6">6a</a>). This was especially true for the red detection channel, monitoring the spectroscopic unchanged quantum dots. As soon as QD655 was accumulated intracellularly, the luminescence decay time decreased and the emission was blue-shifted (green detection channel). Thus, the intracellular quantum dot stability seems to be insufficient and further quantum dot surface modifications are required. Nevertheless, no considerable differences in the intracellular labelling pattern, luminescence decay time and diffusion behaviour could be observed between both types of lipodots. Indeed, also in the case of DOPC:DOPS-lipodots a decrease in the intensity-weighted average decay time from

   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7</a> shows the time-dependent changes in the intracellular luminescence intensity measured in the green detection channel for the two differently composed lipodots compared with free QD655. The application of free QD655 did not result in significant changes compared to the intracellular autofluorescene, indicating their ineffective cellular uptake. On the other hand, the application of encapsulated quantum dots resulted in their sufficient intracellular uptake, however, accompanied with altered luminescence properties. An increase in the luminescence intensity was observed after the initial 5 min bath application of lipodots to the cells, but this change was surprisingly reversible. After approx. 30 min incubation period, the intracellular luminescence intensity slowly decreased, probably due to intracellular degradation. This cellular uptake behaviour was consistent with the findings for two different cell lines, HeLa and GPC
   <span class="sup">PDGF</span>, which showed a rapid uptake of cationic lipodots, although the intracellular luminescence intensity increased continuously, even after 60 min incubation period
