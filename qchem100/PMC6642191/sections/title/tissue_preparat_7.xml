  </span>. In detail, a colony of the American cockroach 
  <span class="italic">P</span>. 
  <span class="italic">americana</span> (L.) was reared at 27 °C under light/dark cycle of 12 h:12 h at the Department of Animal Physiology (University of Potsdam). The animals had free access to food and water. Only male adults were used for experiments. Salivary glands were dissected in physiological saline containing 160 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl
  <sub>2</sub>, 2 mM MgCl
  <sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose and 10 mM Tris, pH 7.4 as described previously

  </span>. Small lobes consisting of several acini with their corresponding branched duct system were examined. Thus, lobes were attached to a glass coverslip of precise thickness (170 ± 5 µm) using the tissue adhesive Vectabond (Axxora, Lörrach, Germany).
