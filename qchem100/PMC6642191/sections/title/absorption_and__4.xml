 <p id="Par9" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Absorption measurements were performed with a Lambda 750UV/VIS spectrometer (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, USA) in the range of 300–700 nm. Luminescence emission spectra (500–800 nm, spectral bandwidth Δλ = 1 nm) were recorded with a FluoroMax 4 (Horiba, Kyoto, Japan) using an excitation wavelength of λ
  <sub>ex</sub> = 480 nm. Concentrations were adjusted to avoid inner filter effects (absorption maximum below 0.1).
