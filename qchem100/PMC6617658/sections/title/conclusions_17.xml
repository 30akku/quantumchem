 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work we address the long-standing challenge of designing effective blue phosphors for OLED applications. The compounds we describe are heteroleptic tris-cyclometalated iridium complexes with mixed-carbene ligation, prepared from isocyanide precursors by a nucleophilic addition/cyclometalation cascade sequence. The photoluminescence attributes of these compounds are admirable. In PMMA thin films, deep blue luminescence is observed for two members of the series, with CIE coordinates that match well with industry standards for blue phosphors. The photoluminescence quantum yields are good and the lifetimes are in the microsecond range, also important criteria for device applications. In short, the pure blue photoluminescence of the mixed-carbene compounds describe here and the potential advantages offered by the ADC moiety motivate continued evaluation of 
  <span class="bold">3aâ€“c</span> and related analogues as dopants for blue OLEDs.
