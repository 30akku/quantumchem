   <span class="sup">ADC</span>) (
   <span class="bold">3a</span>) is negligibly fluorescent in fluid solution, but when immobilized in poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) at 2 wt% deep blue luminescence is observed, with a wavelength of maximum emission of 418 nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield (

   <sub>2</sub> solution complex 
   <span class="bold">3b</span> weakly emits, with a quantum yield of 0.013, and in PMMA the spectrum narrows and the quantum yield increases dramatically to 0.31. Finally, in complex

   <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig7" href="#fig7">Fig. 7</a> shows the computed HOMO and LUMO orbitals for
