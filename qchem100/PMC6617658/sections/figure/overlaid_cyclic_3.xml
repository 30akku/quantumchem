  <div class="title">Overlaid cyclic voltammograms of 
   <span class="bold">3aâ€“c</span>, recorded in acetonitrile with 0.1 M NBu
   <sub>4</sub>PF
   <sub>6</sub> electrolyte. A glassy carbon working electrode, platinum wire counter electrode, and silver wire pseudoreference electrode were used during the measurements, and potentials are referenced to an internal standard of ferrocene. Separate anodic (positive) and cathodic (negative) scans were recorded. Half-wave potentials (
   <span class="italic">E</span>
   <sub>1/2</sub>) are indicated above each oxidation wave, and currents are normalized to bring the plots onto the same scale.
