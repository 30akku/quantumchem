  <p>Overview of all assigned lines. Total view of the transitions that were rotationally assigned in this work. The regions containing assigned lines are printed colour-coded, while the containing raw spectra are printed in grey. The colours denote the isotopologues and the vibronic states that were accessed by transitions from the vibronic ground state
