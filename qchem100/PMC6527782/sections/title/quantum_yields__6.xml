 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">A 4-mL DMA–TEOA (5:1 v/v) solution of the photosesnsitizer (0.1 mM) and BIH (0.2 M) in a quartz cubic cell (light pass length: 1 cm) was purged with Ar for 20 min, and then irradiated with the 500-W Xe lamp combined with a 480-nm (FWHM = 10 nm) bandpass filter (Asahi Spectra Co.), ND filter, and a 5-cm-long H
  <sub>2</sub>O solution filter. UV–vis absorption spectral changes during irradiation were measured using a Photal MCPD-9800 spectrometer (Otsuka Electronics). The light intensity was determined as 5.0 × 10
