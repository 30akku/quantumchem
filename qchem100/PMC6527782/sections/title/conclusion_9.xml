 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Ruthenium(II) picolinate complex, 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span>, successfully functioned as a redox photosensitizer with a much wider wavelength range of visible-light absorption (λ
  <sub>abs</sub> &lt; 670 nm) compared with a fairly typical 
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span> (λ
  <sub>abs</sub> &lt; 560 nm). The system using 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> as a photosensitizer and 
  <span class="bold">Re</span> as a catalyst photocatalyzed the reduction of CO
  <sub>2</sub> to CO by red-light irradiation (λ
  <sub>ex</sub> &gt; 620 nm). TON
  <sub>CO</sub> reached 235 and Φ
  <sub>CO</sub> was 8.0%. Even in the irradiation conditions where 
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span> also absorbed light, i.e., λ
  <sub>ex</sub> &gt; 500 nm, the system using 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> demonstrated faster CO formation (TOF
  <sub>CO</sub> = 6.7 min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and larger TON
  <sub>CO</sub> (2347) than that using 
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span> (TOF
  <sub>CO</sub> = 3.6 min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, TON
  <sub>CO</sub> = 2100).
