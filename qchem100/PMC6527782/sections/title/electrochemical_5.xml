 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Electrochemical spectroscopy to determine the molar absorptivity of OERS was performed using a JASCO PU-980 pump and an EC Frontier flow-type electrolysis cell VF-2 equipped with a carbon felt working electrode (18 mm diameter), a Ag/AgNO
  <sub>3</sub> (10 mM) reference electrode, and a Pt wire counter electrode in an Ar-saturated acetonitrile solution of 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> (0.5 mM) and Et
  <sub>4</sub>NBF
  <sub>4</sub> (0.1 M) as a supporting electrolyte. Applied potential was controlled using an ALS CHI-720Dx electrochemical analyzer and UV-vis absorption spectra were measured using a Photal MCPD-9800 spectrometer (Otsuka Electronics) and a flow-type transmission cell (light pass length: 1.5 mm) (Ishitani et al.,
