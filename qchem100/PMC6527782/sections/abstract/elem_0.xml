 <p>Ruthenium(II) picolinate complex, [Ru(dmb)

  <span class="sup">+</span> (
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span>; dmb = 4,4′-dimethyl-2,2′-bipyridine; Hpic = picolinic acid) was newly synthesized as a potential redox photosensitizer with a wider wavelength range of visible-light absorption compared with [Ru(N

  <sub>3</sub>]
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (N
  <span class="sup">∧</span>N = diimine ligand), which is the most widely used redox photosensitizer. Based on our investigation of its photophysical and electrochemical properties, 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> was found to display certain advantageous characteristics of wide-band absorption of visible light (λ
  <sub>abs</sub> &lt; 670 nm) and stronger reduction ability in a one-electron reduced state (

  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> as a redox photosensitizer combined with a Re(I) catalyst reduced CO
  <sub>2</sub> to CO under red-light irradiation (λ
  <sub>ex</sub> &gt; 600 nm). TON
  <sub>CO</sub> reached 235 and Φ
  <sub>CO</sub> was 8.0%. Under these conditions, [Ru(dmb)
  <sub>3</sub>]
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span>) is not capable of working as a redox photosensitizer because it does not absorb light at λ &gt; 560 nm. Even in irradiation conditions where both 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> and 
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span> absorb light (λ
  <sub>ex</sub> &gt; 500 nm), using 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> demonstrated faster CO formation (TOF
  <sub>CO</sub> = 6.7 min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) and larger TON
  <sub>CO</sub> (2347) than 
  <span class="bold">Ru(dmb)</span> (TOF
  <sub>CO</sub> = 3.6 min
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; TON
  <sub>CO</sub> = 2100). These results indicate that 
  <span class="bold">Ru(pic)</span> is a superior redox photosensitizer over a wider wavelength range of visible-light absorption.
