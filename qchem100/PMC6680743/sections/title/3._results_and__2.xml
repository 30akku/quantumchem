 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The XRD patterns of ZAIS-1, ZAIS-2, and ZAIS-3 areshown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f001" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f001">Figure 1</a>a. The broad peaks of the samples reveal the small-size nature of the NCs. Three diffraction peaks at 28.3, 47.2, and 55.2° areobserved between the peaks of AgInS
  <sub>2</sub> and ZnS, and are practically located at the same diffraction angles of bulk ZnS. These diffraction peaks were attributed to the (111), (220), and (311) planes [
  <a rid="B28-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B28-micromachines-10-00439">28</a>], respectively. This indicated that the XRD diffraction peaks did not originate from the mixture of AgInS
  <sub>2</sub> and ZnS. These results demonstrated that the ZAIS NCs were not a simple mixture of AgInS
  <sub>2</sub> and ZnS but the compositional homogeneous Zn
  <sub>x</sub>Ag
  <sub>y</sub>InS
  <sub>1.5+x+0.5y</sub> solid solution [
  <a rid="B35-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B35-micromachines-10-00439">35</a>]. Moreover, ZAIS-1, ZAIS-2, and ZAIS-3 presented similar diffraction patterns even though the Ag content was different in the precursor. These results indicated that the ZAIS NCs had monocrystalline structures which coincided with the HRTEM measurements (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f001" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f001">Figure 1</a>c). One of the high-resolution TEM images of ZAIS-2 is shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f001" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f001">Figure 1</a>c. It presents the continuous lattice fringes, which indicate the high crystallinity of the ZAIS-2 NCs. The TEM photographs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f001" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f001">Figure 1</a>b) of ZAIS-2 show that the nanoparticles are approximately spherical in shape and comparatively monodisperse. Average particle sizes of the ZAIS samples were 2.8–3.1 nm. The chemical compositions of the ZAIS NCs were determined by ICP-MS analysis. The analysis results areshown in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t001" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t001">Table 1</a>. They indicate that the compositions of purified ZAIS NCs can be precisely controlled, which conforms particularly well to the cationic concentration in the precursor.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The absorption onsets of ZAIS (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f002" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f002">Figure 2</a>a) were blue shifted from ZAIS-1 to ZAIS-7, indicating thatthe band gap energy (E
  <sub>g</sub>) of the ZAIS NCs was augmented with the decreasing Ag content. In the serial ZAIS NCs, while keeping In, S, and Zn (mole% = 20–35%) constant and changing the mole ratios of Ag in the precursor, the PL emission wavelengths were tunable from 450 to 700 nm. The PL wavelengths and corresponding chemical compositions of the ZAIS samples are shown in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t001" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t001">Table 1</a>. The PL and absorption spectra of the ZAIS NCs showed a significant blue shift with the decrease of Ag content. As there were no obvious differences inthe average particle sizes of the ZAIS samples, these results fully revealed the composition-dependent photoluminescence properties of the ZAIS NCs. The onset wavelength varied from 620 to 450 nm. These results agreed well with the phenomena reported in our previous work [
  <a rid="B30-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B30-micromachines-10-00439">30</a>]. The PL peaks of the ZAIS NCs exhibited full width at half maximum around 150 nm. They were remarkably broadened as compared to CdSe but identical to AIS-based NCs. The size-selective precipitation approach [
  <a rid="B22-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-micromachines-10-00439">22</a>] was adopted to reduce the particle size distribution of the ZAIS NCs. However, the broadened features of the PL peaks were totally maintained, similar to CuInS
  <sub>2</sub> NCs. This appeared to result from the donor–acceptor pair radiative recombination of charge carriers generated by surface defects and vacancies. The relative PL QYs of the ZAIS NCs are also shown in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t001" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t001">Table 1</a>. The highest QY reached 35% for ZAIS-4. Most QYs of the ZAIS NCs were higher than those of AIS NCs reported in the literature.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">I-III-VI
  <sub>2</sub>-based ternary and quaternary semiconductor NCs, including AgInS
  <sub>2</sub>, CuInS
  <sub>2</sub>, and Cu(In,Ga)Se
  <sub>2</sub> reported previously, had no sharp exciton band. They all exhibited a broad and large absorption band in the visible to near-IR wavelength region. The displayed broad absorption spectra were also afeature of the ZAIS NCs, regardless of their particle sizes and chemical compositions [
  <a rid="B23-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B23-micromachines-10-00439">23</a>]. The broad and large absorption band of the ZAIS NCs signified a high light absorption coefficient in the solar spectrum and highly efficient light energy conversion. Meanwhile, the large full width at half maximum resulted from the donor–acceptor pair radiative recombination of charge carriers generated by surface defects and vacancies. The precise adjustment of the ZAIS NCs could be advantageous to the synthetic control of surface defects, vacancies, and electronic energy structure and the further control of exciton behavior [
  <a rid="B36-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B36-micromachines-10-00439">36</a>]. By precisely controlling the chemical composition of the ZAIS NCs, the effective transfer of photogenerated electrons and holes was induced, and the PL efficiency of the ZAIS NCs was improved.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The chemical compositions, PL emission wavelength, and QY of ZAIS-4 NCs were significantly influenced by the concentration of an organic capping agent in the precursor. The effects of different DDT dosages on the chemical composition and PL emission properties of the solid solution were investigated and are displayed in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t002" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t002">Table 2</a>. DDT has been documented as an effective capping agent for adjusting the reactivity of metal ions [
  <a rid="B22-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B22-micromachines-10-00439">22</a>]. The chemical composition of the purified ZAIS-4 NCs was decided by the dosage of DDT. The Ag content in the ZAIS-4 NCs was increased with the increase of the DDT dosage in the precursor (shown in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t002" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t002">Table 2</a>). When DDT, in amounts greater or less than 1.0 mmol, was added to the reaction solution, a white precipitate was produced. This suggested that an appropriate DDT concentration was conducive to the formation of a better crystallinity and compositional homogeneity of the ZAIS NCs. The PL emission wavelength of the ZAIS-4 NCs was a blue shift with the decrease of DDT dosage in the precursor, which maybe related to the decrease of Ag content in the ZAIS-4 NCs. As shown in 
  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t002" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t002">Table 2</a>, the QY of the ZAIS-4 NCs was also significantly influenced by the dosage of DDT, which was the key factor in the synthesis of the ZAIS solid solution. The appropriate proportion of DDT in the precursor could prevent the precipitation in the reaction system, increase the fluorescence quantum yield, and improve their optical properties.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The excitation spectra of AgInS
  <sub>2</sub> and the ZAIS NCs are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="micromachines-10-00439-f003" href="#micromachines-10-00439-f003">Figure 3</a>a. Three excitation peaks of ZAIS at about 329 nm, 391 nm, and 459 nm were observed. This coincides with the three peaks of AgInS
  <sub>2</sub>, and a new excitation peak appeared between 226 and 319 nm. It was shown that Zn and Ag in the crystals recombined with the conduction band and valence band of the NCs, forming a new structure of the conduction band and valence band energy of the ZAIS NCs. This was similar to that of Zn-Cu-In-S crystals. Meanwhile, the fluorescence spectra of the ZAIS NCs had single band gap characteristics, and these evidences indicated the formation of alloy states rather than simple composite structures of In-S, Ag-S, and Ag-In-S.

  <sub>2</sub>). Based on the curve-fitting method, the lifetimes of 115–148 ns (τ

  <a rid="micromachines-10-00439-t003" ref-type="table" href="#micromachines-10-00439-t003">Table 3</a>). The average lifetimes calculated according to the formula in the literature [
  <a rid="B37-micromachines-10-00439" ref-type="bibr" href="#B37-micromachines-10-00439">37</a>] were 194, 234, and 237 ns for Ag content of 0.015, 0.01, and 0.005 mmol in the precursors. The fluorescence lifetimes (τ
  <sub>1</sub> and τ
  <sub>2</sub>) were analogous to those of AIS and (AgIn)

The components of 115–148 ns can be assigned to donor–acceptor pair recombination related to surface defects and vacancies. The components of 455–483 ns can be allocated to transitions of intrinsic donor–acceptor pairrecombination [
