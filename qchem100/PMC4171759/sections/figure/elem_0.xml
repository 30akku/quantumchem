  <p>The absolute value of the indirect spin–spin coupling constants (Hz, greater than 0.1 Hz) in valinomycin (left), on a logarithmic scale as a function of the internuclear distance (pm).
   <a rid="b54" ref-type="bibr" href="#b54">54</a> We have used blue, black, red, and green for the CH, CC, CO, and CN coupling constants, respectively. The spin–spin coupling constants have been calculated at the LDA/6-31G level of theory. (Reproduced with permission from Ref 54. Copyright 2004, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.)
