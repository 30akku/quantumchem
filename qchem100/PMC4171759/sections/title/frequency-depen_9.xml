 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Frequency-dependent linear response functions may be calculated at the HF, KS,
  <a rid="b70" ref-type="bibr" href="#b70">70</a> SOPPA,
  <a rid="b71" ref-type="bibr" href="#b71">71</a> and MCSCF levels of theory; at most of these levels of theory, quadratic and cubic response functions are also available. These functions contain a wealth of information not only about the reference state but also about other states of the molecular electronic system.
  <a rid="b72" ref-type="bibr" href="#b72">72</a> For example, the poles of a linear response function (such as the dipole–dipole polarizability tensor) correspond to excitation energies from the reference state (not necessarily the ground state), whereas the corresponding residues represent transition moments between the reference state and the excited states. Quadratic response functions
  <a rid="b73" ref-type="bibr" href="#b73">73</a> such as the first hyperpolarizability tensor provide information about nonlinear molecular response and two-photon processes—for example, coherent two-photon absorption
  <a rid="b74" ref-type="bibr" href="#b74">74</a>,
  <a rid="b75" ref-type="bibr" href="#b75">75</a> and two-photon absorption circular dichroism.
  <a rid="b76" ref-type="bibr" href="#b76">76</a> By means of quadratic response theory, phosphorescence phenomena such as spin-forbidden dipole transitions induced by spin–orbit coupling can be studied.
  <a rid="b55" ref-type="bibr" href="#b55">55</a>,
  <a rid="b77" ref-type="bibr" href="#b77">77</a> Cubic response functions
  <a rid="b78" ref-type="bibr" href="#b78">78</a>–
  <a rid="b80" ref-type="bibr" href="#b80">80</a> such as the second hyperpolarizability tensor give information about three-photon processes
  <a rid="b81" ref-type="bibr" href="#b81">81</a> and excited-state polarizabilities,
  <a rid="b82" ref-type="bibr" href="#b82">82</a> various higher-order spectroscopies such as second harmonic generation circular intensity difference,
  <a rid="b83" ref-type="bibr" href="#b83">83</a> as well as a wide range of birefringences. Many of these properties may be studied in the presence of an externally applied electric field.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Several response functions have been implemented for the CCS, CC2, and CCSD models, including ground-state expectation values,
  <a rid="b84" ref-type="bibr" href="#b84">84</a> excitation energies,
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">85</a> linear response functions,
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">86</a> quadratic response functions,
  <a rid="b87" ref-type="bibr" href="#b87">87</a> cubic response functions,
  <a rid="b88" ref-type="bibr" href="#b88">88</a> and their residues.
  <a rid="b86" ref-type="bibr" href="#b86">86</a>,
  <a rid="b89" ref-type="bibr" href="#b89">89</a> For the CC3 model, response properties including excitation energies have been implemented.
  <a rid="b85" ref-type="bibr" href="#b85">85</a>,
  <a rid="b90" ref-type="bibr" href="#b90">90</a> The double residues of the quadratic and cubic response functions allow first- and second-order properties of excited states—excited-state dipole moments and polarizabilities,
  <a rid="b91" ref-type="bibr" href="#b91">91</a> for example—to be obtained even for single-reference methods.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dalton contains implementations of special methodologies for the calculation of a variety of X-ray spectroscopies, such as X-ray emission, absorption,
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">92</a> shake-up,
  <a rid="b93" ref-type="bibr" href="#b93">93</a> X-ray Raman,
  <a rid="b94" ref-type="bibr" href="#b94">94</a> and X-ray circular dichroism
  <a rid="b95" ref-type="bibr" href="#b95">95</a> spectroscopies. For HF and KS theories, this is accomplished with the ‘static exchange’ approximation
  <a rid="b92" ref-type="bibr" href="#b92">92</a> and the RPA-restricted channel technology, both of which are implemented with integral-direct methods, for applications to large systems such as polymers and surface adsorbates.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In standard response theory, the response functions become divergent under resonance conditions. Such divergences are unphysical, arising from the assumption of infinite lifetimes of excited states. In reality, relaxation mechanisms deplete the excited-state populations, making perturbation theory sound also under these conditions. Using the Ehrenfest theorem, an equation of motion for state vectors that mimics the inclusion of relaxation in density-matrix theory by the Liouville equation has been established.
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">96</a> The resulting complex-polarization-propagator (CPP) approach has been implemented at the HF, KS, MCSCF, and CC levels of theory.
  <a rid="b96" ref-type="bibr" href="#b96">96</a>–
  <a rid="b100" ref-type="bibr" href="#b100">100</a> The CPP response functions are resonance convergent and complex valued, providing a direct means of addressing spectroscopies carried out in regions of electronic resonances such as electronic circular dichroism,
  <a rid="b101" ref-type="bibr" href="#b101">101</a> resonance Raman,
  <a rid="b102" ref-type="bibr" href="#b102">102</a> magnetic circular dichroism,
  <a rid="b103" ref-type="bibr" href="#b103">103</a> and vis/UV/X-ray absorption
  <a rid="b98" ref-type="bibr" href="#b98">98</a>,
  <a rid="b104" ref-type="bibr" href="#b104">104</a> spectroscopies. In Figure 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig02" href="#fig02">2</a>, we have plotted the NEXAFS linear absorption cross-section of Gd acetate nanoparticles, extracted from the imaginary part of the KS CPP electric-dipole polarizability.
  <a rid="b105" ref-type="bibr" href="#b105">105</a> This calculation addresses the spectral region of the carbon K-edge, demonstrating the universal treatment of the spectrum in CPP theory.
