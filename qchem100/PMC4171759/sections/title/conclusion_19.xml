 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We have presented the Dalton quantum chemistry program systemâ€”a highly flexible general-purpose code for molecular electronic-structure calculations. As a result of 30 years of continuous and vigorous development by a large number of authors, Dalton offers today not only a large selection of molecular electronic-structure models (including all standard models) but also the ability to calculate an exceptionally broad range of molecular properties from these models. In this manner, Dalton constitutes a unique tool for quantum-mechanical calculations of molecular systems, ranging from linear-scaling studies of large systems to high-accuracy benchmark studies on small systems.</p>
