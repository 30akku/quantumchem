 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dalton is a general-purpose program system for advanced quantum-chemical molecular electronic-structure calculations, distributed under a license agreement at no cost to the user. With Dalton, molecular systems may be studied using a variety of electronic-structure methods, including the Hartree–Fock (HF) and Kohn–Sham (KS) self-consistent-field (SCF) methods for wide applicability, the multiconfigurational SCF (MCSCF) method for high flexibility, and various coupled-cluster (CC) methods for high accuracy. At all these levels of theory, a wealth of molecular properties may be calculated, enabling the user of the program to study, for example, molecular structure, energetics, reactivity, spectroscopic parameters, linear, and nonlinear optical processes. Small systems may be accurately benchmarked using full configuration-interaction (FCI) techniques. Environmental effects may be incorporated at different levels of theory. For some electronic-structure models, large molecules can be studied using linear-scaling and massively parallel algorithms. In the present paper, we give an overview of the Dalton program system, with illustrations and emphasis on the Dalton2013 release.</p>
