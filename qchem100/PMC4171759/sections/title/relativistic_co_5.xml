 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Although Dalton is a nonrelativistic electronic-structure code based on the Schrödinger equation, it also has some functionality for incorporating the effects of relativity—in particular, effective core potentials may be used for energy and response functions.
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">31</a> Relativistic effects may also be included using Douglas–Kroll–Hess second-order one-electron scalar integrals.
  <a rid="b31" ref-type="bibr" href="#b31">31</a> When molecular response properties are calculated, the Breit–Pauli one- and two-electron spin–orbit operators may be included perturbatively.

  <a rid="b34" ref-type="bibr" href="#b34">34</a> Dalton offers scaled spin–orbit integrals and the atomic-mean-field approximation to the spin–orbit integrals
  <a rid="b35" ref-type="bibr" href="#b35">35</a> and parity-violation integrals.
