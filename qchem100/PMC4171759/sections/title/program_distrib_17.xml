 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The Dalton source code is distributed to users at no cost. Three types of licenses are available: personal, site, and benchmark. With all licenses, the copyright to the code remains with the authors and is not put in the public domainâ€”in particular, the source and binary code may not be redistributed. Furthermore, no fee may be charged for the use of Dalton. For copies of Dalton distributed with a site license, users may not access the source and object files. Benchmark licenses differ from personal and site licenses in that access is given to Dalton only for a restricted period of time. One year after its release, more than 700 personal and 150 site licenses had been issued for Dalton 2011.</p>
