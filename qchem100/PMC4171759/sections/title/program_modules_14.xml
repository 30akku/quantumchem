 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Dalton consists of several modules, developed more or less independently. The HERMIT module calculates not only the integrals needed for energies but also for a large number of molecular properties, including all one- and two-electron integrals of the Breit–Pauli Hamiltonian. The ERI module is a vectorized and distribution-oriented integral generator that is invoked in certain calculations—in particular, in integral-direct CC calculations.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The SIRIUS module contains the (MC)SCF energy optimization code, whereas the CC module performs CC optimizations and property calculations. The LUCITA module performs large-scale CI calculations for general CI expansions and serves the MCSCF module with parallel evaluation of configuration vectors and density matrices. The DFT module performs the numerical exchange–correlation integration and serves the SIRIUS module with the required KS matrix elements.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ABACUS module evaluates second-order properties for the (MC)SCF models—in particular, second-order static molecular properties in which the basis set depends on the applied perturbation. The RESPONS module is a general-purpose code for evaluating response functions, up to cubic response for (MC)SCF wave functions, quadratic, and cubic response for KS theory, and linear response for the SOPPA model. Linear-scaling calculations are performed with the LSDALTON module.</p>
