 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For complicated electronic ground states characterized by static correlation and for valence-excited and core–hole states, MCSCF theory often provides the best solution. Dalton is characterized by an advanced MCSCF functionality with respect to both the construction of the MCSCF wave function and its optimization.
  <a rid="b5" ref-type="bibr" href="#b5">5</a>–
  <a rid="b8" ref-type="bibr" href="#b8">8</a> MCSCF ground- and excited-state wave functions can be constructed using the flexible concept of a generalized active space (GAS),
  <a rid="b9" ref-type="bibr" href="#b9">9</a> including the complete-active-space (CAS) and restricted-active-space (RAS)
  <a rid="b10" ref-type="bibr" href="#b10">10</a> models as special cases. Dalton uses robust and efficient second-order MCSCF optimization techniques, based on the concept of a trust region.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To recover dynamic as well as static correlation, MCSCF theory may be combined with 
  <span class="italic">N</span>-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2).
  <a rid="b11" ref-type="bibr" href="#b11">11</a> The NEVPT2 approach is similar to second-order CAS perturbation theory (CASPT2) but it is not affected by intruder-state problems.
  <a rid="b12" ref-type="bibr" href="#b12">12</a>,
  <a rid="b13" ref-type="bibr" href="#b13">13</a> All MCSCF and post-MCSCF multireference-CI calculations in Dalton are performed using the parallelized LUCITA module
  <a rid="b14" ref-type="bibr" href="#b14">14</a>,
  <a rid="b15" ref-type="bibr" href="#b15">15</a> with the wave function expanded either in configuration-state functions or in Slater determinants. As an important special case, FCI wave functions for benchmarking may be calculated using LUCITA.
