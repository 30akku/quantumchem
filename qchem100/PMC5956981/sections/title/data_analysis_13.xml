 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">2D spectra have been retrieved from the measured photon-echo (PE) signals using the earlier reported procedure.
  <a rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit26">26</a> Briefly, the PE-traces were extracted from the heterodyne signals and transformed along the delay axis 
  <span class="italic">τ</span> using numerical Fourier transforms which provides frequency axis, 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
  </sub>. The observation axis of the spectra corresponding to spectrometer's wavelength scale, were interpolated to the equally-spaced frequencies 
  <span class="italic">ω</span>
  <sub>
   <span class="italic">τ</span>
  </sub>. Using the “invariant theorem”,
  <a rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit26">26</a> phasing of the obtained 2D spectra was performed which provide the correct delay of the local oscillator (LO)-filter used. Phasing of the PE heterodyne signal was performed based on the PP signal at the particular waiting time. The stability of the 2D measurements has been examined by the LO delay.
