 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Using two-dimensional electronic spectroscopic measurements, we have provided direct experimental evidence of strong electronic coupling within the ion-pairs of p-doped organic semiconductors in solution, which is manifest by the well-resolved off-diagonal peaks in the 2D spectra. Our theoretical model simulates the experimental data and unveils an electronic coupling strength of ∼250 cm
  <span class="sup">–1</span> within the ion-pair. The presence of this unexpectedly strong electronic coupling is also perceived by the modulation of the decay times constant of the D
  <sub>1</sub> state of the dopant F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ anion, which is a manifestation of Coulomb interaction with the counter ion. Regarding the structure, we have retrieved an intermolecular distance of ∼4.5 Å between the ions of the ion-pair in solution, which is similar to the reported value for the solution processed films. Thus, the dopant–polymer interaction, which crucially determines the doping efficiencies in doped organic semiconductors, remains essentially unchanged during the microstructural evolution of the doped polymer film from the precursor solution. Our work thereby provides a new level of understanding of the ion-pair in doped polymer systems, which underscores the importance of controlling the intermolecular interactions already in the solution phase to obtain the desired properties in solution-processed films. We see synthetic means to sterically limit close electrostatic interactions as one strategy to weaken this interaction and better enable thermal population of high mobility carrier states to satisfy doping requirements.
