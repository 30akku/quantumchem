  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Polymer PBTTT with 
  <span class="italic">M</span>
  <sub>w</sub> of 40 000–80 000 was purchased from Lumtec, Taiwan. All the materials and solvent were used as received. Blend of PBTTT and F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ was prepared using earlier reported protocol
  <a rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit16">16</a> with slight modification. Firstly, 10 mg ml
  <span class="sup">–1</span> of orange-red colored solution of F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ was prepared in chlorobenzene. Since the high concentration solution of F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ precipitates at room temperature, we heated the solution to 150 °C for 30 min and then kept at 110 °C. The red color solution of PBTTT in chlorobenzene was prepared using the same temperature conditions by adding 10 mg of PBTTT in 1 ml of chlorobenzene. On addition of the F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ solution and PBTTT solution at 110 °C, the color of the solution changes to wine red indicating the formation of ion-pairs in chlorobenzene which was further confirmed by absorption measurements.
