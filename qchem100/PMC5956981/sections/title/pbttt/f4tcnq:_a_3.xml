  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ: a model system for the ion-pair in p-doped organic semiconductors. (a) Unperturbed energy diagram depicting the electronic states of PBTTT and F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ, which are involved in the formation of the ion-pair. Electron transfer (ET) from PBTTT to F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ is favored by the sizable energy offset between the ionization energy (IE) of PBTTT (–5.1 eV) and the electron affinity (EA) of F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ (–5.2 eV). The values of the IE and EA of F
  <sub>4</sub>TCNQ and PBTTT are used from literature report.
