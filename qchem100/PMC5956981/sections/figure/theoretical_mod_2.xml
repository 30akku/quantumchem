  <div class="title">Theoretical model used for calculating the 2DES spectra. (a) The energy diagram of the proposed model. The vibrational dynamics of F
   <sub>4</sub>TCNQ is described by a harmonic oscillator. The polaron formation is modeled by one electronic state which is strongly coupled to the lattice vibrations. (b) Simulated 2D electronic spectra for different waiting times. (c) Comparison of the experimental and the simulated decay dynamics. (d) Proposed molecular configuration of the ion-pair with an intermolecular distance of ∼4.5 Å. For the modeling, cation and anion of ion-pair interact vai π-stacking interaction as proposed by Chabinyc and co-workers.
   <a rid="cit16" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit16">16</a> To treat the dipolar environment properly, the solvent has been modeled as a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators and the dipole–dipole interaction between the ion-pair and solvent has been included in the system-bath interaction.
