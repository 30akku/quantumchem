 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The systematic study reported herein provides the first direct evidence of a dependence of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>1</sub> on metal–ligand covalency. Specifically, longer 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>1</sub> relaxation times for the sulfur donors in 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2</span> in relation to their selenium analogues, 
  <span class="bold">3</span> and 
  <span class="bold">4</span>. Importantly, such covalency appears to engender a significant role for spin-delocalization in copper complexes 
  <span class="bold">2</span> and 
  <span class="bold">4</span>, enabling 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>1</sub>, and consequently, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>2</sub> to persist until room temperature. The significant role of M–L covalency ultimately dictates the potential for the observation of spin coherence at higher temperatures and must be carefully considered when designing molecular qubit candidates. Designing qubit candidates that persist to room temperature offers potential for creating designer qubits for quantum sensing applications within biology. Beyond quantum information science, these results may see impact in dynamic nuclear polarization where spin–lattice relaxation is an important parameter.
