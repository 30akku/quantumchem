 <div class="title">(a) cw EPR spectra collected at 298 K for 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2′</span> (colored spectra) and their best simulations (black). Spin Hamiltonian parameters responsible for the simulations are reported in 
  <a rid="tab2" ref-type="table" href="#tab2">Table 2</a>. (b) Plots of spin densities from the M06-L calculation for 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2</span> with DMF as the solvent. The plots highlight the degree of spin delocalization onto the S-atoms in 
  <span class="bold">2</span> and lack thereof in 
  <span class="bold">1</span>.
