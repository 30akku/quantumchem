 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Correlating spin–lattice relaxation with structural changes necessitates a clear understanding of the structural similarities and differences between the compounds. Notably, the two classes of complexes have significantly different structures. The V
  <span class="sup">4+</span> complex (
  <span class="bold">1</span>) is a hexacoordinate tris-chelate complex in a pseudo-octahedral geometry, while in 
  <span class="bold">2</span>, the Cu
  <span class="sup">2+</span> ion resides in a four-coordinate, square planar geometry. In the solid state, the structure of 
  <span class="bold">1</span> deviates from an idealized trigonal geometry owing to distortions in the arrangements of ligands. The average bond distances between the metal ions and the ligand donor atoms, 2.372(11) Å and 2.279(2) Å for V–S and Cu–S bonds, respectively, agree well with prior crystal structures of other dithiolate species.
  <a rid="cit25" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit25">25</a> Comparison of the average M–L bond distances in 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2</span> reveals that the metal–donor bond distances are all well below those computed using the Shannon–Prewitt ionic radii for Cu
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, V
  <span class="sup">4+</span>, and S
  <span class="sup">2–</span>, with larger deviations observed for 
  <span class="bold">2</span> relative to 
  <span class="bold">1</span>.
  <a rid="cit26" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit26">26</a> These short bond distances suggest enhanced metal–donor covalency in the copper complex relative to its vanadium counterpart. To further probe M–L covalency we investigated both complexes 
  <span class="italic">via</span> X-band (∼9.5 GHz) continuous wave (cw) and pulse electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. As interactions between separate magnetic molecules engender spin–spin relaxation, we synthesized their closed-shell analogues: (Ph
  <sub>4</sub>P)
  <sub>2</sub>[Ti(C
  <sub>6</sub>H
  <sub>4</sub>S
  <sub>2</sub>)
  <sub>3</sub>] and (Ph
  <sub>4</sub>P)
  <sub>2</sub>[Ni(C
  <sub>6</sub>H
  <sub>4</sub>S
  <sub>2</sub>)
  <sub>2</sub>]. We then diluted complexes 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2</span> in a matrix of their respective diamagnetic analogues at concentrations of 0.5%, yielding the compounds (Ph
  <sub>4</sub>P)
  <sub>2</sub>[V
  <sub>0.005</sub>Ti
  <sub>0.995</sub>(C
  <sub>6</sub>H

  <sub>3</sub>] (
  <span class="bold">1′</span>) and (Ph
  <sub>4</sub>P)
  <sub>2</sub>[Cu
  <sub>0.005</sub>Ni
  <sub>0.995</sub>(C

  <sub>2</sub>)

  <span class="bold">2′</span>) (see ESI

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We investigated the diluted compounds by pulse EPR spectroscopy to probe the impact of covalency on spin dynamics. A direct measurement of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>2</sub> is often not possible. Instead the phase memory time, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub>, which encompasses all processes that contribute to electron spin decoherence, which include the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>2</sub> of the electron spin, is measured. Measurement of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> proceeded 
  <span class="italic">via</span> application of a Hahn-echo pulse sequence to 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2′</span> in the temperature range of 5–280 K (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="fig2" href="#fig2">Fig. 2</a>). At 5 K, both complexes feature 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> values of 1.5–2 μs, within the typical range for transition metal complexes. With increasing temperature from 5 K, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>2</sub> increases by ∼1 μs in both complexes. This lengthening occurs until 20 K, wherein 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> peaks for 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2′</span>, reaching values of 2.84(1) and 2.48(2) μs, respectively. The origin of this behavior remains unclear but has been observed in other V(
  <span class="sc">iv</span>) catecholate complexes.
  <a rid="cit19" ref-type="bibr" href="#cit19">19</a> Above 20 K, 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>2</sub> begins to decrease, whereby 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> features a more dramatic temperature dependence relative to 
  <span class="bold">2′</span>. By 100 K, 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> possesses a 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> value of 0.72(6) μs, only slightly shorter than the 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> value of 0.83(1) μs for 
  <span class="bold">2′</span> at 100 K. Interestingly, the echo is no longer detectible in 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> above 100 K. In contrast, 
  <span class="bold">2′</span> displays an echo until 280 K, permitting measurement of 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> at room temperature, with 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> = 0.51(1) μs at 280 K. The drastic discrepancies observed between 
  <span class="bold">1′</span> and 
  <span class="bold">2′</span>, as well as the marginal decrease in 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>m</sub> across such a wide temperature range in 
  <span class="bold">2′</span> prompted us to delve deeper into their electronic structures and evaluate the impact of M–L covalency on 
  <span class="italic">T</span>
  <sub>1</sub> to account for the observed temperature dependences.

  <span class="bold">1′</span> and

  <span class="bold">2′</span> and

  <span class="bold">4′</span> is well-modelled with the inclusion of hyperfine coupling to a 7.6% natural abundance of 
  <span class="sup">77</span>Se nuclei. However, the simulation of 
  <span class="bold">4′</span> is not a precise match, which may stem from non-collinearity of

  <span class="italic">f</span> inversely scales with the number of nuclear spins that are coupled to electron spins by the hyperfine and dipolar interaction. For example, 
  <span class="italic">f</span> is markedly smallest in 
  <span class="bold">3</span>, where the vanadium(

  <span class="bold">3</span> exhibits the most pathways to undergo cross-relaxation. The more severe reduction in

  <span class="bold">2</span> and 
  <span class="bold">4</span> relative to 
  <span class="bold">1</span> and

  <span class="sup">2+</span>–Se covalency, thereby hindering the ability of the field to suppress cross-relaxation involving the 
  <span class="sup">77</span>Se nuclear spins. Our analysis corroborates the idea that hyperfine interactions enable the direct process to dominate at high magnetic fields and enable cross-relaxation pathways at low magnetic fields. Indeed, a recent theoretical study highlights the influence of hyperfine interactions on accelerating spin-relaxation, demonstrating its dominant influence at low magnetic fields.
