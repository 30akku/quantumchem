In the spirit of Quixote this is not intended to be a central permanent resource but one of many repositories. It is available for an indefinite time as a demonstration of the power and flexibility of the system but not set up as a permanent "archive". It may be possible to couple such repositories to more conventional archive-oriented repositories which act as back-end storage and preservation.
