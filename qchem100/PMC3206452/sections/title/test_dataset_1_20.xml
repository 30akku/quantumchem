 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The first use case consisted of 1095 files in Gaussian logfile format contributed by Dr. Anna Croft of the University of Bangor. These were deliberately sent without any human description with the challenge that we could use machine methods to determine their scope and motivation. We have applied the JUMBO-Parser to these, of which all except 5 converted without problems. The average time for conversion was between 3-10 seconds depending on the size of file. These files have now been indexed, mainly from the information in the archive section of the logfile but also with the initial starting geometry and control information. A large number of the files appear to be a systematic study of the attack by halogen radicals on aromatic nuclei.</p>
