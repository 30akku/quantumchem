 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The final output is CML compliant to the 
  <span class="italic">compchem </span>convention and validated against the current validator 
  <span ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://validator.xml-cml.org/" class="ext-link" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">http://validator.xml-cml.org/</span>. The dictionaries are in a constant state of update and consist of a reference implementation on the CML site and a working dictionary associated with the JUMBO-Converters distribution. As concepts are made firm in the latter, they are transferred to the reference dictionary.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The current compchem dictionary is shown in Appendix B. It contains about 90 terms which are independent of the codes. We expect that about the same amount again will be added to deal with other properties and solid state concepts.</p>
