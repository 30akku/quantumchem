 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">This use case comprised of over 5000 files which Henry Rzepa and collaborators have produced over the years and which have been stored Openly in the Imperial College repository (helix). They are much more varied than the Croft sample and include studies on MÃ¶bius computational chemistry, transitional metal complexes and transition state geometries. A considerable proportion of the files emanate from student projects, many of which tackle hitherto novel chemical problems. It is our intention to create a machine-readable catalogues of these files and to determine from first principles their content and, where possible, their intent.</p>
