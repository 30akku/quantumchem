 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In any communal system requiring interoperability and heterogeneous contributions it is critical to agree concepts and construct the appropriate infrastructure. Chemistry has few formal shared ontologies and Quixote explores the scope and implementation of this for QC.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We draw inspiration from formal systems such as the Crystallographic Information File (CIF) created over many years by the International Union of Crystallography (IUCr). This is a community activity with medium-strong central management - the community has an input but there are formal procedures. It works extremely well and is universally adopted by crystallographers, instrument manufacturers, and publishers. The vocabulary and semantics have been developed over 20 years, are robust and capable of incremental extension. We take this as a very strong exemplar for Quixote and more widely QC.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We believe that almost all QC codes carry out calculations and create outpus which are isomorphic with other codes in the community. Thus an "electric dipole", "heat of formation" or a "wavefunction" is basically the same abstract concept across the field. The values and the representation will be code-dependent but with the appropriate conversions of (say) units, coordinate systems and labelling, it is possible to compare the output of one code with another. This is a primary goal of Quixote, and we work by analysing the inputs and outputs of programs as well as top-down abstractions. It also means that Quixote is primarily concerned with what goes into and comes out of a calculation rather than what is held inside the machine (the data model and the algorithms).</p>
