   <span class="bold">Quixote distributed repositories</span>. A schematic view of distributed Quixote repositories. Some repositories push documents to the public web, others aggregate from it. There is (deliberately) no check on whether repositories have identical documents. Users can build search strategies that look for individual entries with specific data or make collections of documents that share or contrast properties.
