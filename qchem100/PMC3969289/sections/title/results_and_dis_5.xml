 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our working hypothesis is that the peculiar and specific interaction of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> with a gamma carboxylated glutamate, in particular γGlu47, may impart distortions in the structure of Cx26 by modifying the interaction between γGlu47 and two proximal arginines (Arg75 and Arg184) in the AA cluster γGlu47-Arg75-Arg184. To investigate the binding mode of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, a bottom-up approach was undertaken, based on state-of-the-art quantum chemistry methods, i.e. hybrid DFT calculations. The first step was the full (unconstrained) geometry optimization of a non-coded γGlu. A monoanionic structure, characterized by a neutral (protonated) and an anion carboxylate adjacent group, was fully optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory. The calculation converged to the same molecular geometry (
  <a rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" href="#s0025">Supplementary Fig. 1A</a>), irrespective of the choice of the carboxylate group which can be initially protonated. In the T-shaped structure the carboxylate groups are arranged in a five-membered ring fashion; the angle O–H–O is close to 160° and the O–H distances are 1.04 and 1.46 Å, respectively.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The optimization of the dianionic form, with both negatively charged adjacent carboxylates, converged, but involved a proton transfer from the N terminus to one carboxylate group (
  <a rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" href="#s0025">Supplementary Fig. 1B</a>). In this case the T-shaped form is preserved but the five membered ring is disrupted. Thus the dianion form with both negative charges on the carboxylate groups is unlikely a standalone species, but in the protein environment where protonated arginines are present in close proximity, it is reasonable to treat γGlu residues as dianions, which are also better candidates for binding calcium. In the optimized γGlu-Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> geometry (
  <a rid="s0025" ref-type="sec" href="#s0025">Supplementary Fig. 1C</a>), the T-shaped structure is retained and the ion is chelated by three O atoms of the two negatively charged carboxylates; the average Ca–O distance is 2.3 Å; the fourth O atom is hydrogen bonded to the close amide group and cannot be involved in calcium binding for steric reasons. The Δ
  <span class="italic">E in vacuo</span> after Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> coordination is −512.9 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, thus the binding is largely favored (
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>). It is worth mentioning that this large value is mainly due to electrostatic contributions and is of the same order of magnitude of binding energies reported for analogous systems 
  <a rid="b0175" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0175">[35]</a>.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Subsequently, two dyads of amino acids were considered, i.e. 
  <span class="bold">γGlu47-Arg75</span> and 
  <span class="bold">γGlu42-Arg75</span> (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>). γGlu42 was examined because Glu42 is close to Glu47, it is another candidate for gamma carboxylation and it too, in principle, could bind Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, although it is not conserved in all connexin isoforms. Both Glu residues face the amino groups of Arg75 and in both dyads, a proton transfer occurs during geometry optimization from Arg75 to one of the carboxylate groups of glutamate, which becomes a monoanion (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the presence of a calcium ion, the two γGlu residues behave very differently (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>B, D). γGlu42 uses its acetyl tail together with its carboxylate groups to bind Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>D), however this imposes a severe distortion to its structure, which is highly unlikely to occur in the protein. By contrast, in the dyad 
  <span class="bold">γGlu47-Arg75</span> with Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (
  <a rid="f0010" ref-type="fig" href="#f0010">Fig. 2</a>B), the ion is chelated by one COO
  <span class="sup">−</span> group of γGlu47 and two N atoms of Arg75, both having their electron pair available after a proton transfer from one of them to the second carboxylate group of glutamate. The binding energy between γGlu47 and Arg75 is −14.7 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, a value which accounts mainly for salt bridge formation since the total charges of the fragments are −1 and 0, respectively. As expected, the binding energy of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> to the γGlu47Arg75 fragment is much larger, i.e. −379.9 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, due to the dominant electrostatic contribution (
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>).
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We finally examined the AA triad 
  <span class="bold">γGlu47-Arg75-Arg184</span> (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>A, B; recall that Arg184, which can interact with γGlu47, belongs to an adjacent connexin). The salt bridge between γGlu47 and Arg75 is maintained in the isolated triad; the second COO
  <span class="sup">−</span> is protonated after a proton transfer from Arg184 (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>A). Note that the backbone of Arg184 is significantly displaced from its initial position, however this rearrangement is unlikely to occur in the protein due to the interactions with the surrounding amino acids. In the presence of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>B) the salt bridge is preserved, although slightly distorted. As in the dyad 
  <span class="bold">γGlu47-Arg75,</span> Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> interacts with three O atoms of γGlu47 and two N atoms of Arg75 (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>B). On the basis of the binding energies computed using two different fragmentations, i.e. γGlu47Arg75 and Arg184 and γGlu47Arg184 and Arg75, we conclude that the interaction between γGlu47 with Arg75 (−111.8 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>) is stronger than the interaction with Arg184 (−18.3 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>). However, the in presence of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, the ion is chelated by γGlu47, the binding of the latter to Arg184 becomes less favorable, and the binding of γGlu47 to Arg75 is neatly unfavorable (−4.6 and +17.3 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>, respectively). This strongly suggests that Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> can alter the local structure, because its binding to γGlu47 prevents any stabilizing interaction between γGlu47 and the close arginines.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To further validate these results, obtained for the model triad 
  <span class="italic">in vacuo</span>, and to take into account properly the protein environment, we constructed a two-layer ONIOM model in which the core formed by portions of γGlu47-Arg75-Arg184 (with and without Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>) is accurately described at B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), and the surrounding amino acids within a sphere centered on γGlu47 with a radius of 4 Å are treated using the PM3 hamiltonian (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>C and D). The geometry of the two-layer ONIOM model was fully optimized (without any constraint). Note that only portions of the three amino acids (and Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span>, when present) were included in the inner layer, as explained in Section 
  <a rid="s0010" ref-type="sec" href="#s0010">2</a>, and shown in ball and stick representation in 
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>C and D. In the triad γGlu47-Arg75-Arg184 extracted from the ONIOM model, the salt bridge between γGlu47 and Arg75 is maintained and no proton transfer from Arg184 to γGlu47 takes place. Indeed, analysis of the binding energies shows the Δ
  <span class="italic">E</span> is much larger, due a stronger electrostatic contribution for this system than for the model triad discussed above (−130.4 vs −18.3 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">−1</span>; see 
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>). In the presence of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>D), the salt bridge is destroyed and Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> binds two oxygen atoms, belonging to each COO
  <span class="sup">−</span> group of γGlu47, as in the isolated triads (
  <a rid="f0015" ref-type="fig" href="#f0015">Fig. 3</a>B). Importantly, this binding mode is identical to that observed in the isolated γGlu47-Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> complex. As in the isolated triad, energy decomposition analysis reveals that the interaction between γGlu47 and the close arginines is disrupted (
  <a rid="t0005" ref-type="table" href="#t0005">Table 1</a>). This result supports the idea that a local bond rearrangement, i.e. binding of Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> to γGlu47 and the breaking of salt bridges between γGlu47 and the neighboring arginines impacts on the energetics and induces a structure rearrangement in a critical region of connexin hemichannels.
 </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To conclude, our results suggest that the post-translationally gamma carboxylated Glu47 is a strong candidate to coordinate Ca
  <span class="sup">2+</span> in the extracellular vestibule of a Cx26 hemichannel. A consequence of this putative coordination action is a rearrangement of the side chains of two highly conserved arginines (Arg75 and Arg184), that are required for the correct functioning of connexin hemichannels and gap junction channels, accompanied by large energetics variations. The salt bridges between Glu47 and Arg184 are considered important to maintain the quaternary structure of the connexin hemichannel 
  <a rid="b0180 b0185" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0180 b0185">[36,37]</a>, and Glu47 is part of the parahelix that is thought to undergo a structural rearrangement to close the hemichannel in response to membrane hyperpolarization and extracellular calcium 
  <a rid="b0190" ref-type="bibr" href="#b0190">[38]</a>. More extensive computations and simulations are currently underway to assess whether this distortion is sufficient to initiate the experimentally observed gating processes.
