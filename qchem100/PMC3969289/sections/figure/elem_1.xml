  <p>(A) Cx26 hemichannel view from the extracellular region. The two extracellular loops connecting the four transmembrane helix are not shown for clarity. Protein backbone is shown in ribbon representation, while residues mentioned in the text are shown in licorice representation: color legend: γGlu42 (green), γGlu47 (orange), Arg75 (yellow), Arg184 (red). (B) Close up view of the residues interacting with γGlu47. Part of two connexins protomers are shown in ribbons. The configuration is taken from an equilibrium MD trajectory, in which in positions 42 and 47 there were two standard (non gamma carboxylated) Glu. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)</p>
