 <div class="title">FF training curve for the octahedral [FeCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span>complex.
 </div>
 <p>The deviation between the DFT and the FF total energy of [FeCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span> is plotted as function of the number of configurations included in the training set. The validation and test sets are always composed of the same 200 configurations. Note that an asymptotic error of the order of 0.015 kcal/mol is achieved. RMSE, root mean square error.
