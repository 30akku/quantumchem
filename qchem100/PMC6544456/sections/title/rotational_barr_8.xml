 <div class="title">Rotational barrier energy profile for the Cp rings of ferrocene.</div>
 <p>The energy profile for the complete reciprocal rotation of the two Cp rings around the Fe
  <span class="sup">+2</span> ion is calculated with both DFT (green line and points) and FF (purple line and points). Note that SNAP describes the energy barrier with an accuracy of about 0.3 kcal/mol.
