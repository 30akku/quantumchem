 <div class="title">FF prediction of the energy profile for Jahn-Teller–active and Jahn-Teller–inactive octahedral complexes.</div>
 <p>The concave (purple/green) and the convex (blue/yellow) surfaces represent the PESs for [FeCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span> and [MnCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span>, respectively. The PES has been scanned in the two-dimensional space defined by the normal modes of vibration with symmetry representation E
  <span class="italic">
   <sub>g</sub>
  </span> of the O
  <span class="italic">
   <sub>h</sub>
  </span> group. The point (
  <span class="italic">Q
   <sub>x</sub>
  </span>,
  <span class="italic">Q
   <sub>y</sub>
  </span>) = (0,0) corresponds to a structure optimized under the constraint of having a perfect O
  <span class="italic">
   <sub>h</sub>
  </span> symmetry. Note that [FeCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span> maintains a minimum at the undistorted O
  <span class="italic">
   <sub>h</sub>
  </span> symmetry, while [MnCl
  <sub>6</sub>]
  <span class="sup">3−</span> undergoes Jahn-Teller distortion.
