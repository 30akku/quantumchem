 <div class="title">SNAP performances for organic and coordination bonds with respect to DFT.</div>
 <p>For each molecule, we report the RMSE on the total energy for the training, validation, and test sets. The molecules span a broad range of bond type. The symmetry of the bond and the symmetry of the coordination environment are reported on top of the plot for the organic and inorganic molecules, respectively.</p>
