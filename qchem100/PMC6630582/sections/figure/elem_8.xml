  <p>Al surface segregation from AlGaN into GaN Qws from the square root of the HA-ADF STEM profile intensity. The fit is obtained after linear background extrapolation and subtraction, modelling all QW profiles as exponential functions with 1/e decay lengths of 1.34 ± 0.04 nm for the leading and 1.45 ± 0.05 nm for the trailing edges (upper interfaces, towards the right).
