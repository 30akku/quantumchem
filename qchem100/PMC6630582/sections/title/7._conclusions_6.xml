 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Strategies have been discussed to detect, distinguish and measure interdiffusion and segregation in semiconductor quantum domain systems using transmission electron microscopy.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For quantum dots, compositional mapping from spectroscopic methods such as STEM-EDXS or EFTEM have been demonstrated to be more reliable than pure imaging approaches, due to problems related to local variations of the specimen thickness that influences the contrast in any type of imaging.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For quantum wells viewed in cross-section, image profiles can be quantified more easily, e.g., in ADF-STEM by calculating the square root of the intensity before fitting any model to a compositional profile. Segregation ratios and segregation lengths can easily be converted into each other as their models are equivalent. Fitting models to very narrow single quantum wells may be prone to errors if the data points contain some degree of noise, while fitting the tails over extended ranges is more reliable.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If chemical profiles of the same structures annealed at different temperatures are compared, it is possible to separate the diffusivities measured into diffusion constants and activation energies for interdiffusion. </p>
