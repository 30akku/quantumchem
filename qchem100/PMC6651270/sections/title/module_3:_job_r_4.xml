 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To enable extension of the set of molecules to be studied or the types of analysis to be carried out, QMflows is from the outset designed to allow for restarts. The workflow and dependencies are stored in a database that is updated with information on successfully completed calculations during the execution of the workflow. When the run command is invoked, noodles traverses the graph of job dependencies and checks against the database for a reference to the job results; if such reference does not exist, then the job is executed, and the resulting output metainformation is stored in the database.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">If the execution of the workflow is stopped by the user or fails for technical reasons, the generated database with metadata can be used to restart the workflows. Noodles will walk through the dependencies tree in the same way as when started from scratch but will query the database for already existing results and execute only the tasks that were not yet successfully completed. This makes the restart procedure very straightforward for the user who will need only to resubmit the original job scheduler script (Slurm or PBS) without modifications.</p>
