 <p>We present the QMflows Python package for quantum chemistry workflow automatization. QMflows allows users to write complex workflows in terms of simple Python scripts. It supports the development of interoperable workflows involving multiple quantum chemistry codes and executes them efficiently on large scale parallel computers. This open source library provides standardized interfaces to a number of quantum chemistry packages and can be easily extended to accommodate additional codes. QMflows features are described and illustrated with a number of representative applications.</p>
