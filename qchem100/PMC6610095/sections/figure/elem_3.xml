  <p>Heatmaps of the root-mean-square deviation between different computational conditions for total electronic energies (in Hartree, top) and atomization energies (in kcal/mol, bottom) of the QM9-G4MP2 sets. The labels of each axis represent the computational conditions invoked by the G4MP2 calculations. The order of computational conditions is given in the order printed in the raw outputs of the G4MP2 calculations.</p>
