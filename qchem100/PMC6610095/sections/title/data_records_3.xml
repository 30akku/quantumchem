   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27" href="#CR27">27</a>
  </span>. Other information that is not included in our table can be obtained by parsing the raw outputs named 
  <span class="italic">dsgdb9nsd_</span>index
  <span class="italic">.log</span>, stored in the output folder. Here, the order of the index is the same as that in the QM9. atom_ref folder containing the output of five (C, H, N, O, F) atoms. Note that not all calculations are performed in identical computational environments. Comparison of the elapsed time among calculations performed in different systems does not represent their relative computational costs. The 
  <span class="italic">result.csv</span> file contains energies computed from different combinations of computational methods and basis sets. It can be generated by running a 
  <span class="italic">parase.py</span> script in the same folders. The details of the columns in the 
  <span class="italic">result.csv</span> file are explained in Table 
  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>. The csv file contains energies for only 133858 cases because the energy values for the molecules whose calculations failed to converge are not included. The indices for 27 structures where we could not obtain converged energies are stored in 
  <span class="italic">index_not_converged.txt</span>. The usage of published scripts and a description of each file in database can be found in the Usage Notes section.
