Most of the geometry optimization was performed within the first few steps; therefore, this simple energy difference can quantify the subtle changes in the molecular structure. Since the total energy referred as B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) in the QM9-G4MP2 database does not include zero-point energy, for the comparison, the reference total energy(E

  <span class="sup">−6</span> Hartree differences would be considered the same value. One possible reason our energies have discrepancies with the energies of the QM9 set is the use of different computation options (e.g., opt = diloose and int = ntultrafine) in some cases of the QM9 set to accelerate convergence. Although discordance greater than the numerical tolerance was observed, chemically meaningful differences (&gt;1 kcal/mol) were observed in only a small fraction of molecules (~0.017%).

  </span> values. This finding means that the newly found conformations in the QM9-G4MP2 set are more stable and likely closer to the global minimum than the QM9 conformations. While the index of 117523 has the largest discrepancy of ~20 kcal/mol, all other cases show 3~5 kcal/mol energy differences. The relatively small energy difference of 3~5 kcal/mol can be sufficiently induced by conformational changes alone, even without connectivity changes. The largest deviation (20 kcal/mol) is observed for the trimolecular systems, which may have many local minima due to complex intermolecular interactions, thus introducing large deviations among conformers.
 </p>
 <p id="Par18" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">By definition of the GDB, every structure in the GDB set should be uniquely determined (i.e., there should be no duplicated structures in the GDB set) and should be a single molecule. In Fig. 
  <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3</a>, we can find two unexpected types of geometries: 1) duplicated structures and 2) multimolecular systems. The cases 53769 and 97313 contain identical chemical structures, and the case indexed 117523 contains more than one molecule in a single system.
 </p>
 <p id="Par19" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">We applied chemical graph representations to both the QM9 and QM9-G4MP2 sets to count the number of duplicate structures and multimolecular systems. Herein, the nodes and edges of graphs represent atoms and chemical bonds. The edges in graphical representations (=chemical bonds) are formed only when the distance of atomic pairs is shorter than the known covalent bond length with a 15% margin
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28" href="#CR28">28</a>
  </span>. Through isomorphic relations among graphs, we can determine whether chemical structures are the same. Additionally, the number of components of chemical graphs corresponds to the number of molecules in the chemical graph, and it is possible to check the identity of chemical structures.
 </p>
 <p id="Par20" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The indices of 252 duplicated systems in the QM9 and QM9-G4MP2 sets could be identified with the script named 
  <span class="italic">count_duplicate.py</span>, and its output can be found in 
  <span class="italic">index_duplicated_structure.txt</span>. Moreover, 229 and 227 systems in the QM9 and QM9-G4MP2 sets, respectively, include more than one molecule. This difference (229 and 227) is caused by the exclusion of the cases indexed 21725 and 87037 from QM9-G4MP2 in the graph analysis due to the abnormal termination of the G4MP2 calculations. We confirmed this analysis by parsing InChI, which distinguishes molecules using dot(.). Therefore, the presence of dot(.) means that the system consists of more than one molecule. The InChI of the QM9 set contains dots for the 229 cases with exactly the same molecules found by 
  <span class="italic">count_duplicate.py</span>. The indices for these 229 cases are listed in 
  <span class="italic">index_multi_mol.txt</span>.
 </p>
 <p id="Par21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">These duplicates and multimolecular structures could be caused by the automated structure generation procedure of the QM9 set. Because the initial geometries for QM9-G4MP2 geometry optimization are adopted from the QM9 set, the two types of unwanted cases mentioned above are also observed in the QM9-G4MP2 set. Although the QM9 and QM9-G4MP2 sets do not completely cover the structure of the GDB set due to inappropriate structure optimizations, the number of problematic structures is only a tiny fraction (~0.01%) of the total size (~134 k) of the database. Therefore, both databases covering large samples of small organic molecules are still valid and irreplaceable.</p>
