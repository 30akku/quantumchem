 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Based on the continuous injection method, a novel approach to overcome a non-radiative recombination of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs was developed by growing a thin CdS shell on the surface of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core. 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1A</a> shows the simulation of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS core/shell structure. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS core/shell QDs clearly show that two types of crystalline structures were formed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1B</a>). Compared to the pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S2</a>), the extra peaks of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS XRD patterns are fairly consistent with the standard XRD patterns of a CdS-liked zinc blende structure. From the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S1b</a>) and CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1C</a>), it can be seen that the point angle of the cubic shape become a circular arc. The high resolution TEM image of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> (the inset of 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S1b</a>) and CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs (the inset of 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1C</a>) clearly exhibit the crystal lattice (110) of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> nanoparticles and further verify the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS core/shell structure. In addition, the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs exhibited a typical cubic shape with a larger average size (22.1 nm) than that of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs (12.7 nm; 
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S1</a>). To further demonstrate the successful formation of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core and CdS shell, the mapping analysis and energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs was employed (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figures 1D,E</a>) with the S and Cd elements uniformly distributed on the surface of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core. Moreover, the PL spectra of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs has a slightly blueshift (from 519 to 514 nm) compared with pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QD (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F1" href="#F1">Figure 1F</a>), which was probably induced by the CdS shell. A similar phenomenon was found and ascribed for the cationic inter-diffusion at the interface between the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core and CdS shell (Oladeji and Chow, 
  <a rid="B14" ref-type="bibr" href="#B14">2005</a>; Li et al., 
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2011</a>; Kwak et al., 
  <a rid="B10" ref-type="bibr" href="#B10">2015</a>). On the other side, the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS showed a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 88% (
  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1" href="#SM1">Figure S3</a>) and the full width at half-maximum (FWHM) was as narrow as 19 nm, which is similar to pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2A</a>, the inverted QLEDs structure was fabricated with a sandwich structure of ITO (In
  <sub>2</sub>O
  <sub>3</sub>-SnO
  <sub>2</sub>)/ZnO:Mg/QDs/CBP/MoO
  <sub>3</sub>/Al, which was constituted by the transparent electrode ITO as a cathode, Mg doped ZnO as an electron transport layer, perovskite QDs as the light-emitting layer, CBP as a hole transport layer, Al as an anode, and MoO
  <sub>3</sub> as a hole injection layer. The flat-band energy levels of devices are shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figures 2B,C</a>. After perovskite QDs were coated on the ZnO:Mg electron transport layer, the perovskite film was still soluble in organic solvents due to the presence of aliphatic ligands on the QDs. The structure above the light emitting layer was prepared by evaporation (

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">As shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figures 2D,E</a>, the peaks of the QLEDs EL spectra based on CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs and CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs were consistent with the PL spectra, and the luminescence intensity increased with the voltage increase. The EL of pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs based LEDs (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2D</a>), peaking at 519 nm with a FWHM of ~20 nm, was observed. And there is no emission peak from the hole/electron transport layer. The CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs based QLEDs also performed with a peak at 516 nm with a FWHM of ~20 nm. As depicted in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F2" href="#F2">Figure 2E</a>, the emission from the hole/electron transport layer was hardly shown. The insets showed an operating device driven at 4 V, and the devices both exhibited a saturated and pure green color.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the potential application in a light emission device, the characteristic of emitter layers is extremely important. For the inverted QLEDs with the CsPbBr
  <sub>
   <span class="bold">3</span>
  </sub> QDs emitting layer, the pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs worked with poorer luminous characteristics, exhibiting a lower maximum luminance intensity of 65 cd/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> and the maximum CE of 0.14 cd/A (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figures 3A,B</a>). It is worth mentioning that a maximum luminance of 354 cd/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> was obtained when the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs were used as the emitting layer, and the maximum CE was boosted to 0.3 cd/A (
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="F3" href="#F3">Figures 3C,D</a>). The overall performance of two kinds of devices were also described with the average EQE. The EQE of QLEDs with the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs emitting layer (0.4%) was 5.4 times larger than the pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs (0.07%). The results are tabulated in 
  <a rid="T1" ref-type="table" href="#T1">Table 1</a> for comparison. Based on the same device structure with a different emitting layer, the turn-on voltage of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS based QLEDs was slightly lower than CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> based QLEDs. Moreover, the maximum CE of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS based QLEDs was 2.1 times larger than the pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> based QLEDs, which could be ascribed to the valence bands (conduction bands) of the CdS shell which are lower (or higher) than that of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core, and a non-radiative Auger recombination of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> was effectively suppressed (Park et al., 
  <a rid="B15" ref-type="bibr" href="#B15">2014</a>; Nasilowski et al., 
  <a rid="B12" ref-type="bibr" href="#B12">2015</a>; Niu et al., 
  <a rid="B13" ref-type="bibr" href="#B13">2017</a>). Additionally, the probable reason could be attributed to the fact that the extra carriers cannot escape from the surface of the QDs as the protecting layer of CdS, which leads to a higher radiative recombination rate, higher luminance and EQE.
