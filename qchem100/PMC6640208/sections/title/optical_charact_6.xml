 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Photoluminescence spectra were measured by Agilent Cary Eclipse spectrograph FLS920P. XRD characterization was done by Shimadzu/6100 X-ray diffractometer, using a Cu Kα radiation source (wavelength at 1.5405 Å). TEM images were recorded on a Zeiss/Libra 200 FE. The PLQY measurements were carried out in solutions with an Edinburgh Instruments fluorescence spectrometer (FLS920), which included a xenon lamp with monochromator for steady-state PL excitation. A calibrated integrating sphere was used for PLQY measurements. The EL spectra and luminance (
