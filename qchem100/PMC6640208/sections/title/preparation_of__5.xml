 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The cleaned ITO/glass was treated under UV–ozone for 30 min. The ZnO:Mg nanoparticles were spin-coated onto ITO/glass at 3,000 rpm for 40 s, and annealed at 100°C for 10 min. The perovskite QDs were deposited by spin-coating at 2,000 rpm for 60 s. CBP (40 nm), MoO
  <sub>3</sub> (10 nm), and Al (100 nm) electrodes were deposited using a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask under a high vacuum of ≈1 × 10
  <span class="sup">−4</span> Pa. All device operations were performed in a nitrogen-filled glove box.
