 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In conclusion, we have developed novel all-inorganic core/shell perovskite QDs and applied it as an emitting layer in inverted QLEDs (ITO/ZnO:Mg/QDs/CBP/MoO
  <sub>3</sub>/Al). The results show that the fabricated CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs based QLEDs exhibited enhanced performance compared with pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs based QLEDs. The EQE of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs was 5.4 times higher than that of pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs, which demonstrates that the introduction of a CdS shell can increase the optoelectronic performance. The core/shell structure perovskite QDs present a new route of perovskite materials for light emission applications.
