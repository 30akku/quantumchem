  <sub>3</sub>/CdS Core/Shell QDs Synthesis
 </div>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the synthesis of CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> core QDs a protocol by Protesescu et al. (
  <a rid="B16" ref-type="bibr" href="#B16">2015</a>) was adopted. One hundred milligram Cs
  <sub>2</sub>CO
  <sub>3</sub> was loaded into a 100 ml 3-neck flask along with 4 ml 1-octadecene, and 0.5 ml OA (oleic acid), then heated under N
  <sub>2</sub> to 120°C until the powder was completely dissolved. Five milliliter ODE and 69 mg PbBr
  <sub>2</sub> were loaded into a 100 ml 3-neck flask and heated under N
  <sub>2</sub> to 120°C 1 h. 0.5 ml OME and 0.5 ml OA was injected at 120°C under N
  <sub>2</sub>. After the PbBr
  <sub>2</sub> salt was completely dissolved, the temperature was raised to 150°C and the Cs-oleate solution (0.4 ml, 0.125 M in ODE, prepared as described above) was quickly injected and, 5 s later, the reaction finished. Four milliliter ODE, 1 ml Cd-oleate solution, and 0.4 ml 1 M sulfur in OME solution, was mixed when the reaction for CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs finished and added dropwise over 20 min to the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> solution at 150°C under N
  <sub>2</sub> flow. After the addition was complete, the mixture was allowed to react for 20 min at 150°C and was subsequently cooled by an ice-water bath, washed with toluene several times, and dispersed in toluene.
