 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">For the synthesis of Cd-oleate solution a protocol by Li et al. (
  <a rid="B11" ref-type="bibr" href="#B11">2011</a>) was adopted. A 0.38 M Cd-oleate solution was made by dissolving 383 mg CdO in 3.9 ml oleic acid and 3.9 ml ODE at 280°C under N
  <sub>2</sub> flow. After 1 h the CdO was dissolved and the clear solution was degassed for 30 min at 110°C.
