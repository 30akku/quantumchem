 <p>Novel CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS core/shell structure quantum dots (QDs) were successfully synthesized using a facile hot-injection method. The corresponding CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs based light-emitting diodes (QLEDs) were further prepared, which demonstrated the maximum luminance of 354 cd/m
  <span class="sup">2</span> and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.4% with the current efficiency (CE) of 0.3 cd/A. Moreover, the optoelectronic performance of the CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS QDs based QLEDs exhibited a comparable enhancement in contrast to the pure CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub> QDs based QLEDs. Hypothetically, the novel CsPbBr
  <sub>3</sub>/CdS structure QDs introduced one new route for advanced light emission applications of perovskite materials.
