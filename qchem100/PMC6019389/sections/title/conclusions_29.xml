 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The molecular geometries; electronic structures; quantum chemical descriptors; and infrared, Raman, RMN, and UV-Visible spectra of the EPI, EPIIS, ISOP, PILO, and MAC alkaloids have been studied by DFT calculation. The theoretical model B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p) was the most satisfactory to describe all the studied properties, and can be considered suitable for use as a reference for similar structures that showed this pharmacological activity. This work provides new insight to the potential of these molecules as drugs against schistosomiasis, through the identification of previously unknown properties, expansion of the field of study, and enabling the discovery of novel treatments for this disease.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The ADMET profile showed that the EPI alkaloid and its isomers are suitable for the standard Lipinski classification of drugs, with positive parameters in PPB, BBB, HIA and CYP inhibitors, besides having low toxicity and carcinogenicity with more than 90% probability of having good solubility and permeability.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Molecular docking evidenced that the EPIIS alkaloid was the ligand that presented better affinity parameter for UP and TGR proteins, indicating a possible drug candidate for this disease.</p>
