 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The prediction of pharmaceutical parameters was conducted using the freely available pre-ADMET® and FAF-Drugs4® software packages. The in sílico methodology used with the EPI, EPIIS, ISOP, PILO, and MAC molecules included physical–chemical parameters, drug-likeness profile, pharmacokinetic profile (ADME), and toxicity. Among the most relevant parameters of absorption were the observation of the ability of the drug to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB), as well as the drug absorption rate (Caco2), the rate of absorption by human intestinal cells (HIA) and excretion (MDCK). Regarding the metabolization process, the capacity of inhibition, non-inhibition and substrate formation by the molecules through their behavior on CYP-450 subfamilies was evaluated [
