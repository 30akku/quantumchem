 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Alkaloid geometry, electronic, and vibrational properties were studied using the program Gaussian 09 [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref024" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref024">24</a>]. The GaussView 5.0.8 [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref025" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref025">25</a>] software was used to obtain 3D structural models. Geometric optimization calculations were performed in accordance with DFT [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref026" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref026">26</a>] by combining the B3LYP [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref027" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref027">27</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref028" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref028">28</a>] functional hybrid and basis sets SDD, 6–31+g(d,p), and 6–311++g(d,p) [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref029" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref029">29</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref030" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref030">30</a>]. Frequency calculations were performed to obtain thermodynamic properties and to verify that each optimization achieved an energy minimum.

  <sub>HOMO</sub>), and the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (E
  <sub>LUMO</sub>) [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref031" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref031">31</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref032" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref032">32</a>]. All calculations were performed in the gas phase. Time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) was used to calculate the energies and intensities of electronic transitions [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref033" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref033">33</a>–
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref034" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref034">34</a>]. The calculated electronic transitions, infrared, and Raman spectra were convoluted by using Gaussian functions with half-widths of 25.000 cm
