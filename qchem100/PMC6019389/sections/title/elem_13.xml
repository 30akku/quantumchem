 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The relative energies between the isomeric alkaloids demonstrated that the EPI alkaloid was more stable than the others compounds (

  <a ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0198476.s004" href="#pone.0198476.s004">S4 Table</a>). In the three theoretical models, the energy ranking was similar. However, as expected, the B3lyp/6-311++G(d,p) model showed that EPI was more stable between isomers compared with ISOP, by approximately 1.79 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">-1</span>, followed by EPIIS (3.29 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">-1</span>) and PILO (6.16 kcal mol
  <span class="sup">-1</span>). The stability may suggest a greater number of alkaloids among the studied isomers. The chemical structure of these alkaloid isomers is evidence of the difference in their stability across the dihedral angles (
  <a rid="pone.0198476.t002" ref-type="table" href="#pone.0198476.t002">Table 2</a>); by acquiring a cis conformation, the PILO alkaloid tends to be less stable compared with EPI, which is the most stable, given of its trans configuration. In this way, chemical reactions induced by light, temperature, or electricity [
  <a rid="pone.0198476.ref045" ref-type="bibr" href="#pone.0198476.ref045">45</a>] could easily result in the conversion of these less-stable models to more trans models, such as ISOP, which is isomeric with PILO, by changing conformation.
