  <p>Normal modes of a water molecule in the molecular plane (arrows show the extent and directionality (color) of the nuclear displacement along the mode): Symmetric stretch ν
   <sub>1</sub>, bending mode ν
   <sub>2</sub>, and antisymmetric stretch ν
   <sub>3</sub>. The top-row shows sketches of the harmonic oscillator densities along the modes for the first excitation of the bending mode (010), the bottom row for the first excitation of the antisymmetric stretch (001). A light filling of these densities indicates that locally other modes point in the same direction, while a dark filling means that this is not the case.
