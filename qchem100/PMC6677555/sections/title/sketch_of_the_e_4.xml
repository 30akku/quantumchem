 <p>(
  <span class="bold">A</span>) HD molecules are prepared in the state ∣
  <span class="italic">v</span> = 1, 
  <span class="italic">j</span> = 2, 
  <span class="italic">m</span> = 0〉 using Stark-induced adiabatic Raman passage (SARP) (
  <a rid="R30" ref-type="bibr" href="#R30">
   <span class="italic">30</span>
  </a>). Then, we can divide them into two molecular beams (two groups). If we apply the Pumps and Stokes electric field along the 
  <span class="italic">y</span> axis, then HD in group I is set at state ∣
  <span class="italic">H</span>〉 (orientation of HD is along the 
  <span class="italic">y</span> axis, parallel to the direction of its propagation). The molecule HD in group II is set at state ∣
  <span class="italic">V</span>〉 (orientation of HD is along the 
  <span class="italic">z</span> axis, norm to the direction of its propagation). One molecule from group I and another from group II are combined together, and then, HD pairs are prepared at different initial states (if we do nothing, then these pairs will stay on a mixed state ∣
  <span class="italic">H</span>〉 ⊗ ∣ 
  <span class="italic">V</span>〉). (
  <span class="bold">B</span>) The specific prepared state will go through two channels, molecule in channel I will scatter with H
  <sub>2</sub> clusters, where the bond axis of H
  <sub>2</sub> is distributed isotropically. (
  <span class="bold">C</span>) Sensors (orange) are used to detect scattered particles and count numbers for each angle (
  <span class="italic">Z</span> measurement). Molecules that are not scattered will go to another sensor (gray), by which they will be measured on the eigenstates ∣ + 〉 and ∣ − 〉 (
  <span class="italic">X</span> measurement). (
  <span class="bold">D</span>) In channel II, we set another experiment, so that scattered prepared HD molecules with isotropically distributed H
  <sub>2</sub> clusters are measured under
