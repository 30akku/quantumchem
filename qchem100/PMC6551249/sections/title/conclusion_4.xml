 <p id="pr0170" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Modulation of a few important NLO properties (EOE, TONOS and TODF) of doped QD by the variation of binding energy has been investigated. In this context the role of noise is thoroughly scrutinized. EOE and TONOS display steady fall as BE increases without noise and when MLN operates. However, in presence of ADN, above two NLO properties reveal persistent amplification with increase in BE. On the other hand, TODF decreases with increase in BE under all conditions. Thus, the rise/fall of NLO properties with BE depends on the existence/non-existence of noise, the noise mode and also on the particular NLO properties concerned. The pattern of peak-shift of the NLO properties with BE is conspicuously linked with the presence of noise although we do not find any remarkable role played by the noise mode. All the NLO properties invariably delineate blue-shift (no shift) with increase in BE when noise becomes absent (present). The observations bear importance in the study of NLO properties of LDSS when noise displays some crucial role.</p>
