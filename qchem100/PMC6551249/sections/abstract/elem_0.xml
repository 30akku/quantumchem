  </div> quantum dot (QD). In the study ample stress is given on understanding the role of noise on the manifestations of these NLO properties. The profiles of these NLO properties are analyzed mainly on the basis of variation of two important criteria viz. peak-shift and peak-height as a function of BE. Both these features depend on the presence of noise, its pathway (mode) of introduction and sometimes on the identity of the NLO properties. The findings of the study deem significance in realizing the binding energy-dependence of the said NLO properties of low-dimensional semiconductor materials when noise contribution becomes noticeable.
