  <p>Schematic illustration of the band structure and optical transitions of monolayer Mo
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <sub>2</sub> and W
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <sub>2</sub>. Shown are the spin-dependent band structures near the 
   <span class="italic">K</span> and 
   <span class="italic">K</span>′ points, derived from first-principles calculations

   </span>, including the (helicity-selective) optical transitions and electronic configurations involved in 
   <span class="italic">A</span> excitons and associated negatively charged trions (the lower spin–split valence band is not shown). Singlet trions are intervalley in Mo
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <sub>2</sub> but intravalley in W
   <span class="italic">X</span>
   <sub>2</sub>; the situation is reversed for triplet trions. Note that the depicted vertical transitions become mixed as a result of quasiparticle interactions
