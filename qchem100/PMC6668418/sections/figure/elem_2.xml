  <p>Exciton–trion quantum beats in two-dimensional spectroscopy. 
   <span class="bold">a</span> Total (singlet plus triplet) trion two-dimensional electronic spectrum of monolayer MoSe

   <span class="bold">b</span> Time-dependent signal at the lower cross-peak (X–X
   <span class="sup">−</span>) location for MoSe
   <sub>2</sub> (red) and WSe
   <sub>2</sub> (blue), shown together with an exponential indicating the phenomenological exciton–trion coherence decay (black dashed). For WSe
   <sub>2</sub>, results are shown for fully degenerate singlet and triplet trions (solid), and for which the triplet trion is blue-shifted by 7 meV as a result of exchange interactions (dashed). Shown in all cases are the real (absorptive) part of the complex signal
