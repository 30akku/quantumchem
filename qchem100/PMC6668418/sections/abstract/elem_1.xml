 <p id="Par2">2D electronic spectroscopy found experimental indications of coherently interacting excitons and trions in doped transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Here, the authors perform simulations of 2D spectra of monolayer TMDCs based on a many-body formalism, allowing to relate exciton-trion coherence to quantum beats based on microscopic principles.</p>
