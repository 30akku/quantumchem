  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">Supplementary Methods</a>. Our many-body formalism can in principle be combined with an ab initio treatment of the full band structure of TMDCs. For the results presented here, we instead used the two-band model introduced by Xiao et al.

  <span class="italic">K</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K</span>′ valleys at arbitrary sampling resolution. The Brillouin zone was discretized using a Monkhorst–Pack grid, while a truncation radius was imposed around the 
  <span class="italic">K</span> and 
  <span class="italic">K</span>′ points. Excitons and trions are described using the Bethe–Salpeter equation and its generalization to three-body systems
