 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The interaction between H
  <sub>2</sub>O and the coal pyrite was mainly through the interaction between O of the former, and C and Fe of the latter. Therefore, only the PDOS values of O, C and Fe were plotted before and after adsorption [

  <sub>2</sub>O was adsorbed on the different locations of the pyrite surface doped by carbon atoms (shown in 
  <a ref-type="fig" rid="molecules-24-02285-f006" href="#molecules-24-02285-f006">Figure 6</a>bâ€“d), similarly to the results of the ideal surface [
  <a rid="B19-molecules-24-02285" ref-type="bibr" href="#B19-molecules-24-02285">19</a>], the covalent bond and anti-bond were formed between the water molecule and the pyrite surface through the O 2p orbital and the Fe 3d orbital. The bonding energy between Fe and O was very strong, while the anti-bonding was quite weak. However, the strength of the covalent bond increased with the distance from the carbon defect centre, which was close to that of the ideal pyrite surface.
