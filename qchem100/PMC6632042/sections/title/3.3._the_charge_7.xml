 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The charge transfer refers to the loss and transfer of electrons between atoms after adsorption of adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent, which was expressed by the Mulliken charge population (MCP), as shown in

  <a rid="molecules-24-02285-t007" ref-type="table" href="#molecules-24-02285-t007">Table 7</a>, before adsorption (BA) and after adsorption (AA) of H
  <sub>2</sub>O on the surface of the ideal pyrite and at different positions of pyrite doped with carbon atoms.

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Similar to the MCP results of atoms on the ideal surface, after the adsorption of H
  <sub>2</sub>O at the different sites of the pyrite surface with carbon defects, whether the water molecule adsorbed at the doping-position, ortho-position or meta-position, the negative charge of the oxygen atom in the water molecule also decreased due to the loss of approximately 0.20 e of the O 2p orbital, and the positive charge of the Fe atom on the surface also increased due to the gain of approximately 0.07 e, which may be the similar adsorption results of the single water molecule at various positions. Finally, electron aggregation enabled H
  <sub>2</sub>O to be stably adsorbed on the pyrite surface.
