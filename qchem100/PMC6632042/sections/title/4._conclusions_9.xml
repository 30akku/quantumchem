 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(1) The calculation results of the adsorption energy showed that whether the water molecules were adsorbed on the doping-position, the ortho-position or the meta-position of the coal pyrite, the water molecules can adsorb on all positions of the surface spontaneously. With the distance from the defect centre, the negative value of adsorption energy increased gradually, which was close to that of the ideal surface. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(2) The Feâ€“O covalent bond was mainly formed after adsorption, and the strength of covalent bonding was doping-position &lt; ortho-position &lt; meta-position, lower than the ideal surface. The interaction between the water molecule and the pyrite surface mainly depended on the covalent bonding and anti-bonding through the 2p orbital of the oxygen atom and the 3d orbital of the iron atom. </p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">(3) It was not only shown that, compared with the undoped surface, the hydrophilicity of the coal pyrite surface with carbon defects decreased at the defect site, but also that the degree of hydrophilicity reduction decreased gradually with the distance of the ortho-position and the meta-position from the defect centre. Whatever the doped site or the undoped site, the hydrophilicity decreased. The weakening of the hydrophilicity at the doping-position, ortho-position and meta-position resulted in the overall weakening of the hydrophilicity on the coal pyrite surface from the molecular level.</p>
