 <p>To investigate the effect of carbon defects on the hydrophilicity of the whole surface of the coal pyrite, the adsorption of the single H
  <sub>2</sub>O molecule at different sites of the coal pyrite surface was studied with the DFT calculation. It was found that, like the ideal pyrite, the single H
  <sub>2</sub>O molecule can stably adsorb at the doping-position, the ortho-position and the meta-position of the coal pyrite. The covalent bond and anti-bond were formed between O (water molecule) and Fe (the coal pyrite) through the Fe 3d orbital and O 2p orbital. Meanwhile, the S–H bond was replaced by the C–H bond. But away from the carbon defect centre, the adsorption of the single H
  <sub>2</sub>O molecule increased gradually and the Fe–O covalent bond strength between the single H
  <sub>2</sub>O molecule and the pyrite strengthened, which eventually became close to that of the undoped coal pyrite surface.
