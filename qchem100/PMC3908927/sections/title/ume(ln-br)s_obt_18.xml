 <div class="title">UME
  <sub>(Ln-Br)</sub>s obtained using the RM1 model for the lanthanides and all five versions of the Sparkle Model: Sparkle/RM1, Sparkle/PM7, Sparkle/PM6, Sparkle/PM3 and Sparkle/AM1 for all complexes of the universe set for each of the lanthanide trications: Dy(III), Ho(III) and Er(III).
 </div>
 <p>The UMEs are calculated as the absolute value of the difference between the experimental and calculated Ln-Br interatomic distances, summed up for all complexes, for each of the lanthanides. The RM1 model for lanthanides UME
  <sub>(Ln-Br)</sub> bars are very small. Besides, there are no Ho-Br distances in the universe of Ho(III) complexes considered.
