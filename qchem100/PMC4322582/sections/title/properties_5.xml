 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">All molecular geometries were relaxed, and properties calculated, at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p) level of theory. The list of properties of the 134k molecules is summarized in 
  <a ref-type="table" rid="t3" href="#t3">Table 3</a>. For a subset of 6,095 isomers of C
  <sub>7</sub>H
  <sub>10</sub>O
  <sub>2</sub>, energetics (properties 12â€“16) were additionally calculated at the G4MP2 level of theory. For a validation set of 100 randomly drawn molecules from the 133,885 GDB-9 set, enthalpies of atomization were calculated at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31G(2df,p), G4MP2, G4 and CBS-QB3 levels of theory.
