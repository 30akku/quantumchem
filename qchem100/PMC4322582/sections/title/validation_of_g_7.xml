  <a ref-type="fig" rid="f2" href="#f2">Fig. 2</a> for a flow-chart of this consistency check. Out of the 134k molecules, 3,054 molecules did not pass this test. This is due to the fact that SMILES and InChI representations are not unique because transformation of Cartesian coordinates to string based chemical identifiers is prone to implementation specific artifacts. For molecules with same topology, small differences in interatomic distances, bond and dihedral angles can lead to different molecular graphs encoded by the string. To quantify this artifact, the distribution of Coulomb-matrix distances

 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Consider, for example, molecule indexed 58 in the 134k set, which is among the 3,054 molecules for which the consistency check failed. Its original GDB-17 SMILES corresponds to NC(=N)C#N, and Cartesian coordinates can be generated using Corina. When feeding back these coordinates to Open Babel to perform the inverse task of reproducing the initial SMILES string, [NH]C(=[NH2])C#N is obtained instead. By contrast, performing first a geometry relaxation of the Corina generated Cartesian coordinates using PM7 followed by B3LYP, and only then parsing through Open Babel, recovers the original SMILES string. In this case,

As a result, parsing back these geometries with Open Babel yields different SMILES strings. Note that all the 6,095 constitutional isomers of C
