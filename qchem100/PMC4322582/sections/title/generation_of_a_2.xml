  </span> strings for molecules with up to nine heavy atoms. Cations, anions, and molecules containing S, Br, Cl, or I, have been excluded, resulting in 133,885 molecules. 1,705 zwitterions have been kept in the data due to their occurrence in small biomolecules, such as amino acids. Initial Cartesian coordinates for all molecules were generated by parsing the corresponding SMILES strings using Corina (Version 3.491 2013)

   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b17" href="#b17">17</a>
  </span>. We subsequently carried out geometry relaxations at the PM7 semi-empirical level of theory using MOPAC (Version 13.136L 2012)
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b18" href="#b18">18</a>
  </span>. In the PM7 calculations, we invoked tight electronic and geometric convergence thresholds, using 
  <span class="monospace">precise</span> keyword. PM7 equilibrium geometries have subsequently been used as input for B3LYP geometry relaxations using Gaussian 09
  <span class="sup">
   <a ref-type="bibr" rid="b19" href="#b19">19</a>
  </span>. We iteratively refined the electronic and geometry thresholds. For the first iteration, Gaussian 09’s default electronic and geometry thresholds have been used for all molecules. For those molecules which failed to reach SCF convergence 
  <span class="monospace">ultrafine</span> grids have been invoked within a second iteration for evaluating the XC energy contributions. Within a third iteration on the remaining unconverged molecules, we identified those which had relaxed to saddle points, and further tightened the SCF criteria using the keyword 
  <span class="monospace">scf(maxcycle=200, verytight)</span>. All those molecules which still featured imaginary frequencies entered the fourth iteration using keywords, 
  <span class="monospace">opt(calcfc, maxstep=5, maxcycles=1000). calcfc</span> constructs a Hessian in the first step of the geometry relaxation for eigenvector following. Within the fifth and final iteration, all molecules which still failed to reach convergence, have subsequently been converged using 
  <span class="monospace">opt(calcall, maxstep=1, maxcycles=1000). calcall</span> constructs a Hessian for all steps through the the geometry relaxation. After all these measures taken, eleven problematic molecules still failed to converge to a minimal geometry. Out of these eleven molecules, six can be converged with low threshold using the 
  <span class="monospace">opt(loose)</span>-keyword. In the remaining five there were two near-linear molecules which converged to saddle points with very low imaginary frequencies (
