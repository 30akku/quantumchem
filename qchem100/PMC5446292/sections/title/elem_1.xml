  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The aim of this work is to compare different high-level theories for the calculation of the adsorption energy of a single water molecule on the (001) LiH surface, keeping the atomic structure of the surface fixed. The adsorption energy is defined as the difference in energy between the non-interacting fragments (water and the LiH surface) and the interacting system (water molecule on LiH),

   </div>An alternative definition for the adsorption energy is the difference between the energy of the system with the water molecule at its equilibrium position on the surface and that of the system in which the water molecule has been displaced vertically by 10 Å. In both definitions, the molecular structure of the water molecule has been kept the same. The latter definition is used for the DMC calculations since it allows to maximize the possible cancellation of errors.

   </a> We stress that since we are primarily interested in benchmarking different electronic-structure methods, zero-point energy contributions or finite temperature effects are neglected. The structure of the surface with the adsorbed molecule has been obtained in the following manner. The Li and H atoms have been kept fixed to their pristine lattice sites with a lattice constant of

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The calculations using a plane-wave basis set presented in this work have been performed using the 
   <span class="sc">vasp</span> code employing the PAW method alongside with the Γ-point approximation to sample the first Brillouin zone. The kinetic energy cutoff that determines the size of the plane-wave basis set expansion of the one-particle states was set to 500 eV. There are numerous density-functionals that could be considered, of which we have only chosen a small selection. Thus, we assess the accuracy of one of the most widely used functionals, the PBE functional, as well as of several van der Waals functionals. Specifically, dispersion corrections were taken into account following the approach of Grimme

In the former schemes, a correction is added to the DFT total energy after the self-consistent-field (SCF) cycle is converged, whereas the latter scheme is a non-local correlation functional that approximately accounts for dispersion interactions. In all calculations, all electronic states of the H and Li atoms were treated as valence states, whereas the 1

  <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In the current paper, we employ pseudized Gaussian-type orbitals (PGTOs) expanded in a plane-wave basis set to span the virtual orbital manifold necessary for the quantum chemical MP2 and coupled-cluster methods. The space of the occupied orbitals from the HF calculation is projected out from the PGTOs, ensuring that they solely span the virtual space. The rediagonalization of the Fock matrix in this newly constructed virtual space allows for a canonical formulation of quantum chemical techniques. This enables considerably fewer states to be involved in many-body calculations.
   <a rid="c54" ref-type="bibr" href="#c54">

   <span class="sc">vasp</span>. To further reduce the computational cost of coupled cluster methods, we first minimize the number of virtual orbitals. Pseudized Gaussian orbitals were placed only on the top-most layer of the LiH slab. In a second step, the auxiliary plane-wave basis, required for the evaluation of the Coulomb integrals, employed a kinetic energy cutoff of 100 eV.
