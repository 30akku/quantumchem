 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The UVâ€“Vis spectra were recorded on a Specord S-600 diode-array spectrophotometer (Analytik Jena, Germany). The emission measurements were carried out by using a Fluoromax-4 (Horiba Jobin Yvon, Longjumeau, France) spectrofluorometer equipped with a time-correlated single-photon counting accessory for determination of fluorescence lifetimes. A 393-nm nanoLED was applied for the latter purpose. AMKO LTI photolysis equipment containing a 200-W Xe-Hg lamp and a manually operated monochromator was used for continuous irradiations. The samples were irradiated in glass cuvettes with path lengths of 1 and 5 cm for Soret- and Q-band excitations, respectively. All measurements were carried out at room temperature. Homogenization was ensured by a magnetic stirrer. The irradiated solutions were kept in the dark for one day to check the stability of the photoproducts. Digital evaluations of the experimental data were realized by various procedures using an MS Excel program.</p>
