 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Samarium(III), europium(III), and gadolinium(III) were used as chloride salts. Tetrasodium salt of 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-sulfonatophenyl)porphyrin (H
  <sub>2</sub>TSPP
  <span class="sup">4âˆ’</span>) was applied as a water-soluble porphyrin ligand. Acetic acid and sodium perchlorate were used as ionic strength adjustors. The previous one was also applied for buffers in combination with sodium hydroxide. 1,10-phenanthroline and potassium trisoxalatoferrate(III) were utilized for actinometric measurements. All chemicals were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Ltd. (Budapest, Hungary) as reagent-grade materials and used without further purification. Argon gas was utilized for deoxygenation of the samples. Doubly distilled water treated with a Millipore Milli-Q system (Millipore SAS., Molsheim, France) was the solvent in this work. The samples for experiments were prepared by using stock solutions of appropriate concentrations. In order to reach the equilibrium state, the solutions were kept in a dark oven at 333 K for at least one day.
