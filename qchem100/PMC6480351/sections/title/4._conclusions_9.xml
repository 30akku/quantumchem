 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Our results regarding the photoinduced properties of anionic lanthanide(III) porphyrins clearly indicated that in the case of medical applications where excitation of these complexes by visible light occurs (e.g., in photodynamic therapy and luminescence imaging), their photochemical and photophysical behavior ought to be taken into consideration. Since samarium, europium, and gadolinium are in the middle of the lanthanide series, the observed photoinduced features well represent the common (average) characteristics of such Ln(III) complexes.</p>
 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">The concentration-dependent dimerization of the OOP-type monomers through the peripheral sulfonato substituents hardly affects their fluorescence due to the weak interaction between the constituting units, which is advantageous for their usage in diagnostics by luminescence imaging. However, their photolysis reactions (both degradation and dissociation) might be a drawback in their application in diagnostics, although their quantum yields are low. Nevertheless, the photoinduced redox reactions may provide opportunities for their application in photodynamic therapy. Hence, these observations may promote careful selections of appropriate lanthanide(III) porphyrins for various medical applications, considering the aims and conditions of such procedures.</p>
