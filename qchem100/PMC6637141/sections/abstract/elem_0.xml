 <p id="Par1">Sandwich complexes are an indispensable part of organometallic chemistry, which is becoming increasingly important in the field of lanthanide-based single molecule magnets. Herein, a fundamental class of pure sandwich complexes, [(η
  <span class="sup">9</span>-C
  <sub>9</sub>H
  <sub>9</sub>)Ln(η
  <span class="sup">8</span>-C
  <sub>8</sub>H
  <sub>8</sub>)] (Ln=Nd, Sm, Dy, Er), is reported. These neutral and sandwiched lanthanide compounds exclusively contain fully π-coordinated coplanar eight and nine membered CH rings. The magnetic properties of these compounds are investigated, leading to the observation of slow relaxation of the magnetization, including open hysteresis loops up to 10 K for the Er(III) analogue. Fast relaxation of the magnetization is likewise observed near zero field, a highly important characteristic for quantum information processing schemes. Our synthetic strategy is straightforward and utilizes the reaction of [(η
  <span class="sup">8</span>-C
  <sub>8</sub>H
  <sub>8</sub>)LnI(thf)
  <sub>n</sub>] complexes with [K(C
  <sub>9</sub>H
  <sub>9</sub>)]. Although all compounds are fully characterized, structural details of the title compounds can also be deduced by Raman spectroscopy only.
