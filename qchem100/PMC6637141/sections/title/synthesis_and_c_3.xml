  <span class="bold">3d</span> show a disorder of the eight and the nine-membered rings (see 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">Supplementary Information</a> for details). Especially the molecular solid-state structure of 
  <span class="bold">3d</span> exhibits a complicated disorder with split positions of the Er(III) ion, showing slight indications of ring slipping and tilting in both ligands. The Er-C distances in the eight-membered ring vary between 2.406(11) Å and 2.670(10) Å with 5 carbon atoms closer located to the Er(III) ion than the others. Similarly, the Er-C distances in the nine-membered ring vary between 2.468(12) Å and 2.733(10) Å with four carbon atoms in closer proximity to the Er(III) ion (see Supplementary Table 
  <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a> for detailed bond lengths). However, this might also be caused by the unusual split Er(III) positions and thus, do not reflect the actual binding mode of the two aromatic moieties. We, therefore, performed a DFT geometry optimization and found the energetic minimum for

  <span class="bold">3d</span> to comprise two fully π-coordinated and coplanar aromatic ligands, although the solid-state structure does not undoubtedly proof this assumption. On the other hand, 
  <span class="bold">3a</span> and 
  <span class="bold">3b</span> did not show this type of disorder. Their solid-structures exhibit perfect sandwich-type configuration with both rings bound to the central lanthanide ion in a coplanar fashion (Fig.

  <a rid="Tab1" ref-type="table" href="#Tab1">1</a>). In compound 
  <span class="bold">3a</span>, the neodymium atom is centered between both rings with Nd-C bond lengths of 2.613(8)–2.653(8) Å to the eight-membered ring and Nd-C bond lengths of 2.845(6)–2.915(7) Å to the nine-membered ring. The distances of the Nd atom to the ring centroids (Cg) are Nd-Cg(8) 1.8925(3) Å and Nd-Cg(9) 2.0441(3) Å. The Cg(8)-Nd-Cg(9) angle accounts for 176.47(1)° and underpins an almost ideal coplanar arrangement. Interestingly, the η
