   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">Supplementary Information</a> for details). Especially the molecular solid-state structure of 
   <span class="bold">3d</span> exhibits a complicated disorder with split positions of the Er(III) ion, showing slight indications of ring slipping and tilting in both ligands. The Er-C distances in the eight-membered ring vary between 2.406(11) Å and 2.670(10) Å with 5 carbon atoms closer located to the Er(III) ion than the others. Similarly, the Er-C distances in the nine-membered ring vary between 2.468(12) Å and 2.733(10) Å with four carbon atoms in closer proximity to the Er(III) ion (see Supplementary Table 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">10</a> for detailed bond lengths). However, this might also be caused by the unusual split Er(III) positions and thus, do not reflect the actual binding mode of the two aromatic moieties.

   <span class="bold">3a</span> and

  <p id="Par16" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">An open magnetic hysteresis is the ultimate proof of the strong anisotropic behavior in SMMs and their bistable magnetic behavior. Extrapolation of the Arrhenius data to low temperature indicates that the observation of magnetic hysteresis below 12 K is feasible, where the relaxation time is 100 s. To confirm the SMM behavior and the slow relaxation observed through AC studies, magnetization hysteresis loops were collected between 1.8–10 K. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig7" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig7">7c</a> shows butterfly-like hysteresis loops between 2 and 10 K and a field ranging from ±2 T, leading to a blocking temperature (
   <span class="italic">T</span>
   <sub>B</sub>) of 10 K. Note that, albeit the energy barrier being rather large, the hysteresis loops are practically close at zero field, strongly indicating that QTM is rather efficient, as commonly observed in lanthanide-based SMMs.
