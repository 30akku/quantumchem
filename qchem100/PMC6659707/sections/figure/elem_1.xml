  <p>IP of pairs of one anion and one solvent molecule with respect to the isolated species. Bars represent the average over 30 configurations of each pair, with the 
   <span class="italic">x</span>-axis showing the anion and the color indicating the solvent used (blue: DMSO; green: DME; orange: PC; red: ACN; gray: isolated anion). Values for the isolated species (
   <span class="italic">y</span>-axis for the solvent, gray bar for the anion) are averaged over 50 configurations. Dashed bars represent constant shifts 
   <span class="italic">δ</span> = 2.8 eV (drawn for pairs where the solvent is oxidized). IPs are well approximated by Eq. (
