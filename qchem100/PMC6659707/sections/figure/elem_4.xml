  <p>Figure 
   <span class="bold">a</span> represents for 200 configurations of anion-solvent pairs from MD snapshots for the (TFSI
   <span class="sup">−</span>, PC) pair, the distribution in energy computed from MD and the distribution of energy computed from DFT (M06-HF). Both these distributions are plotted relative to their average. 
   <span class="bold">b</span> shows a solvated anion for an MD snapshot in the case of the (TFSI
   <span class="sup">−</span>, DME) pair. 
   <span class="bold">c</span>–
   <span class="bold">e</span> show examples of configurations of solvent-anion pair from MD snapshots for the (TFSI
