  </span>. CdSe nanoplatelets were first synthesized at 240 °C from Cd myristate, Cd acetate, and Se power in 1-octadecene. They were then precipitated with ethanol and re-dispersed in a mixture of 1-octadecene and oleylamine in a three-neck flask. A suspension of Se in oleylamine was added into the flask as well. The contents of the flask were then degassed at room temperature for 10 min, heated up to 140 °C under nitrogen and maintained in this condition for 10 min. After injecting a certain amount of tributylphosphine into the flask, the temperature of the mixture was increased to 220 °C. The solution was then allowed to cool to 37 °C. Finally, ground Cd formate was added to the mixture and it was stirred for an hour.

 <p id="Par13" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Transmission electron microscopy of the samples were performed using a 300 kV FEI Tecnai F30 microscope. Absorption and emission spectra of the solutions were collected using a Cary 5000 UV-Vis-NIR spectrometer and FluoroMax-4 spectrofluoremeter, respectively.</p>
