 <p id="Par11" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In summary, we find that the symmetry-related electronic properties of nanostructures are highly susceptible to both geometrical variations and the local atomic structures. In our QR structure, the combination of these two effects leads to a localization of the wavefunctions and consequently, a uniaxial transition dipole moment in a two-dimensional QR structure. Our finding not only has important implications for the quantum photonic applications of QRs

Specifically, the introduction of optical spin-orbit coupling through an asymmetric ring geometry may enable the occurrence of an optical Berry phase for photon manipulation and the examination of non-trivial topological effects
