  <p id="Par7" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">Since the interaction strength of optical emitters with light is indicative of their intrinsic TDMs, we apply two independent imaging approaches to reveal the TDMs of the CdSe QRs. In both approaches, isolated CdSe QRs with random azimuthal orientations are dispersed on substrates and loaded onto home-built confocal laser microscopes. We excite the CdSe QRs at a wavelength of 633 nm to ensure that only band-edge optical transitions are involved. We first investigate the QRs utilizing angle-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy on a Fourier imaging system (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2c</a>. See Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for a detailed description of the setup). This technique allows direct imaging of 
   <span class="bold">k</span>-vector resolved emission projections containing information about the orientations of the TDMs

   </span>. It is essential that a high numerical aperture (NA = 1.4) objective is used to focus the laser beam onto a single QR at a time and collect the corresponding emission. Intensity distributions of the QR emission at the back focal plane of the objective are recorded by a charge-coupled device. Our numerical simulations (see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">2</a> for details) show that the 
   <span class="bold">k</span>-vector resolved emission pattern of a uniaxial TDM lying horizontally on a sample surface forms two bright lobes, whereas that of a uniaxial TDM lying vertically to the sample surface form a circular ring with an intensity nearly isotropic in the azimuthal angle (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2a, b</a>). The distinct boundary between an inner and an outer region in the momentum space corresponds to the critical angle (
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <sub>C</sub>) of total internal reflection at the glass-air interface, and radiation emits predominantly at angles larger than the critical angle into the high refractive index medium. The outer circle is defined by the maximum collection angle of the objective used in the measurements (
   <span class="italic">θ</span>
   <sub>NA</sub>). Figure 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2d, e</a> show representative 
   <span class="bold">k</span>-vector resolved radiation patterns measured from single CdSe QRs. Calculated radiation patterns of in-plane uniaxial dipoles with their azimuthal orientations adjusted to match the experimentally measured patterns are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2g, h</a>. Good agreement between the experimentally measured and theoretically simulated radiation patterns can be observed. This is further confirmed by comparing the 
   <span class="bold">k</span>-vector resolved emission profile cuts from the experiments and calculations (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig2">2i</a>). Additional

  <p id="Par8" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To consolidate our conclusion of the uniaxial, in-plane nature of the TDMs in CdSe QRs, we apply a second approach based on higher-order laser scanning microscopy to study the absorption in QRs. This approach has been used to study TDMs of organic molecules

   </span>. When an individual particle is raster scanned through the focus of a higher-order Bessel–Gauss laser beam, its excitation pattern is characteristic of its TDMs at the excitation wavelength. Figure 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3a, b</a> shows the calculated transverse and longitudinal field components within the focal region of a radially polarized laser beam according to the parameters used in our experiment. The corresponding field intensity profiles are shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3c, d</a>. When a uniaxial TDM lies horizontally in the sample plane, it interacts mainly with the transverse component of the radially polarized laser beam, leading to an excitation pattern consisting of two bright off-axis lobes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3e</a>). In the case that the uniaxial dipole lies perpendicularly to the sample plane, primarily the longitudinal component of the radially polarized laser beam interacts with the dipole, giving rise to an intense spot in the center. The relatively weak interaction between the transverse component of the laser beam and the vertical dipole results in a weak ring around the intense spot (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3f</a>). Comparison between the calculated and experimentally measured excitation patterns enables the determination of the dimensionalities and orientations of the TDMs. Excitation patterns of individual CdSe QRs scanned through radially polarized laser beams exclusively show two bright off-axis lobes (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3g</a>). The intensity profiles from the experimentally measured patterns and calculated patterns of a horizontally lying uniaxial dipole show a reasonable agreement (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig3">3h</a>). These results confirm our conclusion about the uniaxial, in-plane nature of the TDMs in CdSe QRs. We note that the TDMs studied here are the intrinsic properties of the QRs given their specific composition and geometry, while their emission polarization may not be uniaxial due to the renormalization effect caused by the differences in the dielectric constants of the QRs and their surrounding environment

  <p id="Par10" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">To simulate the QR structures with realistic potentials, we solve for the band-edge states using an empirical tight-binding method utilizing the QNANO computational platform (see Methods for details)

   </span> is much smaller than the thermal energies in our experiments. These calculations show that in realistic QRs, though the pure geometry is still a factor, a three-dimensional, atomistic ring adds additional complexity to the electronic structure. This is because the discrete nature of the atomic positions breaks the continuous rotational symmetry present in the infinite ring potential, even in the case of OD

   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>1</sub> =

   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c, d</a>) (see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a> for vertical cross sections). Here, the wavefunction of the lowest conduction band level (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) is no longer perfectly symmetric as was observed for the infinite well potentials, although it is still generally delocalized around the ring and keeps the 
   <span class="italic">s</span>-type character. The overlap of the electron (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4c</a>) and hole (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4d</a>) wavefunctions results in a two-dimensional optical transition dipole moment with components along both the 
   <span class="italic">x</span> and 
   <span class="italic">y</span> axes. For CdSe QRs with OD
   <sub>1</sub> = 13.3 nm, OD
   <sub>2</sub> = 9.9 nm, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 3.6 nm, and 
   <span class="italic">h</span> = 5.0 nm (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g, h</a>), both the oval nature of the quantum ring and the atomic structure break the rotational symmetry. In this case, the elongation of the QR leads to the localization of wavefunctions in the thick end of the oval-shaped rings for both band edge states (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4g, h</a>), although the wavefunctions are still mostly delocalized around the whole ring, and hence has a two-dimensional transition dipole. There are still some effects from the local atomic structures, which break the symmetry between the left and right lobes, although the effects are less significant compared to these in QRs with a smaller thickness (see Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">4</a> and 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">5</a> for ring thickness dependent atomic structure effects). For the ring geometry that most closely represents our experimentally measured QR samples, the differential thickness (
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>1</sub> = 3.6 nm, 
   <span class="italic">t</span>
   <sub>2</sub> = 3.0 nm) further breaks the rotational symmetry and causes additional localization of the wavefunctions in the thick end of the ring, as shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k, l</a>. This strong, geometry-induced localization leads to a uniaxial, in-plane dipole, as was observed in our experimental measurements. We note that even though the rings vary slightly in size and shape, they are essentially ovals with certain thickness variations (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">1</a>). As shown in Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig4">4k, l</a> and Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">3</a>–
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">7</a>, this geometry, over a wide range of possible parameters, gives rise to mostly uniaxial dipoles. Our simulations also show that the specific symmetry breaking between the different wavefunction lobes varies for QRs with various crystallographic orientations (Supplementary Note 
   <a rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media" href="#MOESM1">6</a>), but their TDMs still remain uniaxial and in-plane. Moreover, the calculated energy difference between the two band edge states of 1.84 eV matches very well with the experimentally observed band edge absorption and emission wavelengths (Fig. 
   <a rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig" href="#Fig1">1c</a>).
