 <p>We present the non-adiabatic, conical-intersection quantum dynamics of the title collision where reactants and products are in the ground electronic states. Initial-state-resolved reaction probabilities, total integral cross sections, and rate constants of two H
  <sub>2</sub> vibrational states,

  <span class="italic">E</span>
  <sub>coll</sub>, reaction probabilities and cross sections increase monotonically up to 3 eV, remaining however quite small. When H
  <sub>2</sub> is in the

  <sub>0</sub> = 1 state, the reactivity increases by ~2 orders of magnitude at the lowest energies and by ~1 order at the highest ones. Initial-state resolved rate constants at room temperature are equal to 1.74 × 10
