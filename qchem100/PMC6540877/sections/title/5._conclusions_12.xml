 <p xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">In this work we have presented an accurate full dimensional potential energy surface for the CO-N
  <sub>2</sub> system, characterized by an extension of the bond-bond formulation of the intermolecular interactions. The PES, intended for use in dynamics simulations aimed at calculating sets of accurate state-to-state rate coefficients, has been validated by performing Quantum-Classical dynamics simulations of the CO-N
  <sub>2</sub> vibrational energy exchange, with outcoming rate coefficients in substantial agreement with experimental data on a wide range of temperatures. The generation of large pools of kinetics data and accurate molecular properties to feed databases employed in astrochemical models, plasma chemistry and combustion studies, is a current challenge for theoretical and computational chemistry, with a strong multidisciplinary character. Here we suggest to set up cloud-oriented computing infrastructures based on collaborative computer modeling and simulations to gather communities and boost efforts.
